<h4>3)  Safe School Initiative Project </h4>
<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
<h4>The North Eastern states of (Borno, Adamawa, Yobe and Gombe) and some other states in Nigeria have witnessed unprecedented insurgency and conflicts from 2009 to date leading to an estimated over 2 million IDPs all over the country with more than 300,000 living in IDP camps. The education sector has negatively been affected and schooling has continuously been disrupted by Boko Haram insurgency. School children were killed, abducted, displaced leading to a high level of trauma. More than 254 schools were destroyed and facilities burnt down. Most public schools in Borno states have been closed since 2014 as the schools have been converted to IDP camps.</h4>
<h4>The Safe Schools Initiative was launched by the UN Special Envoy and former UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown following the terrorist group, Boko Haram attack and abduction of more than 200 school girls from Government Secondary school Chibok in Borno State, North East Nigeria in 2014.</h4>
<h4>The Steering Committee is chaired by Honourable Minister of Finance. The Technical Committee is chaired by the DG NEMA. Programme implementation is carried out by the Technical Committee. Other members of the Committees include NEMA, FME, and Development Partners such as DFID, UNICEF, USAID and the German government (GIZ), NSA and Nigeria Business Leaders</h4>
<h4>The Safe Schools Initiative in Nigeria has so far received funding from the Nigeria government, the Business Community in Nigeria, Foreign Governments and international donor agencies </h4>
<h4>UNICEF is supporting IDP students in various camps in Borno, Adamawa and Gombe States. Various intervention programmes designed in conjunction with FME include purchase of 40 School-in-a- box, 800 School bags to schools in camps and 35,000 school bags with learning materials for students in IDP camps.</h4>
<h4>2069 out of 2400 IDPs have been transferred to 43 federal unity colleges in the North Central, North West and North East and are gradually adjusting to academic life in the schools.</h4>
<h4>Safe Schools Initiative and DFID in conjunction with the Nigerian Army Engineering Corp have conducted an assessment of the scope of work needed to reconstruct 30 damaged schools in the insurgency ravaged areas in the first instance.(Ten schools per state)</h4>
<h4>There are now  over 7 million out-of-school children as a result of the insurgency. </h4>
<h4>USAID in conjunction with Education in Crisis and conflict network (ECCN) organised a workshop in Nigeria for education stakeholders in Adamawa, Borno, Bauchi and Yobe state  on  </h4>
<h4>education in crisis environments in Northern Nigeria.</h4>
<h4>PROJECT UNDER BASIC AND SECONDARY EDUCATION:</h4>
<h4>STATE EDUCATION PROGRAMME INVESTMENT PROJECT (SEPIP)</h4>
<h4>A.BRIEF ON SEPIP</h4>
<h4>1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION</h4>
<h4>The State Education Programme Investment Project (SEPIP) is a World Bank assisted project which is coordinated by the Federal Ministry of Education, Basic and Secondary Education Department, to support Education Programs implemented by the participating States of Anambra, Bauchi and Ekiti to improve the quality, access and efficiency of their education. </h4>
<h4>SEPIP is a pilot project (financed by a US $ 150 million Specific Investment Credit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which in turn disburses part of the funds to the three participating States through subsidiary financing agreements) which supports the design and implementation of educational activities in the three participating States at basic and secondary education level over the period from March 2013 to October 2017. </h4>
<h4>The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support: </h4>
<h4>(a)need-based teacher deployment;</h4>
<h4>(b)measurement of student learning in participating States; and</h4>
<h4>(c)school level management and accountability; </h4>
<h4>This will contribute to, and complement, the programs and priorities of participating States in addressing education access, quality and efficiency issues, through their own funding, financing from UBEC and other government agencies, as well as other development partners.</h4>
<h4>The project supports five critical results which are agreed performance indicators captured by the five Disbursement –linked Indicators (DLIs) namely:</h4>
<h4>DLI 1: Teacher Deployment in Rural Areas</h4>
<h4>DLI 2: Teacher Deployment in Core Subjects</h4>
<h4>DLI 3: Assessment of Student Achievement</h4>
<h4>DLI 4: Technical and Vocational Schools</h4>
<h4>DLI 5: School-Based Management Committees (SBMCs)</h4>
<h4>PROJECT COMPONENTS: </h4>
<h4>The project consists of two components: </h4>
<h4>Component 1(US $ 125 million): A results-based financing supporting participating States’ education sector reform programme to improve the quality, access and efficiency of their education system. The results-based component features a relatively novel approach of disbursements conditional to achievement of DLIs.</h4>
<h4>Component 2 (US $ 25 million): This component provides technical assistance channeled through two levels: (a) State level (US $ 20 million) - supporting participating States towards achievement of DLIs, and the associated institutional capacity strengthening; and </h4>
<h4>(b) Federal level (US $ 5 million) – supporting the Federal Ministry of Education (FME) and UBEC in overall project coordination and in providing the enabling environment in line with national policies, and in ensuring sustainability and scaling-up of successful activities in other potential States, for instance in Edo State.</h4>
<h4>2.0KEY ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT IN THE PROJECT FROM INCEPTION</h4>
<h4>SEPIP was declared effective on August 27th, 2013.</h4>
<h4>The National launch of the project took place on 18th October, 2013.</h4>
<h4>SEPIP – was launched in Anambra on November 5th, Ekiti State on November 21st and Bauchi State on November 29th 2013.</h4>
<h4>The National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) has been constituted and was inaugurated on 19th December, 2013.</h4>

<h4> 3.0YEAR 1 (2013) PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS</h4>
<h4>The project is on track to meet its development objectives and the project implementation process has been smooth. </h4>
<h4>The FPSU successfully procured the services of individual consultants for the verification of achievement of the first year (2013) DLI targets. </h4>
<h4> Anambra</h4>
<h4>Based on independent verification, Anambra State met its Disbursement Linked Indicator (DLI) targets for the first year (2013), consequently, the State claimed full disbursement against 2013 DLIs amounting to over US $ 10 million.</h4>
<h4>Bauchi</h4>
<h4>After independent verification and validation, it was confirmed that Bauchi State met all five DLIs for Year 1 (2013). The State therefore claimed full disbursement against 2013 DLIs amounting to over US $ 10 million.</h4>
<h4> Ekiti</h4>
<h4>Similarly, based on independent verification and validation, Ekiti State met all five DLIs for 2013 consequently, the State claimed full disbursements against DLIs for Year 1, amounting to over $10 million.</h4>
<h4> Federal Ministry of Education</h4>
<h4>The Federal Ministry of Education (FME) provides policy guidance and chairs the National Project Steering Committee, which is responsible for overall coordination and monitoring of project implementation, assisted by UBEC.</h4>
<h4>4.0YEAR 2 (2014) IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS</h4>
<h4>Implementation towards the timely achievement of the DLIs for the second year (2014) has largely been concluded in all the three States with the support of the Federal Ministry of Education. Presently, verification of the achievement of the DLIs for 2014 has been carried out in the three participating States by a firm of Independent verifiers and the verification reports, reviewed by the FPSU-FME have been sent to the World Bank where they are currently receiving attention.</h4>
<h4> 5.0YEAR 3 (2015) IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
<h4>In certain instances, the States have carried out implementation beyond the targets set for the achievement of the 2014 DLIs. However, the independent verification of the achievement of DLIs beyond 2014 would be carried out in due course.</h4>
<h4> B.OUTLINE OF ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT IN 2014/2015</h4>
<h4>Brief outline of activities carried out under the Project in 2014/2015 include:</h4>
<h4>•Technical assistance to support key policy reforms</h4>
<h4>•Training and capacity building</h4>
<h4>•International study tours</h4>
<h4>•Provision of policy guidance for smooth project implementation</h4>
<h4>•Implementation Support Missions</h4>
