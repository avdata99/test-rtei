      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
          <em>This study was carried out to  examine and analyze the use of corporal punishment in disciplinary control of  secondary schools students in Delta State. Two research questions were raised  and one hypothesis was generated and tested. 515 principals were selected  through the use of the multi-stage random sampling technique from 41 secondary  schools in Delta State. Data were collected with the aid of a structured  questionnaire and were analyzed with simple percentage and Z-test statistics.  The findings revealed that: corporal punishment is the most frequently used  form of punishment in secondary school; corporal punishment is not an effective  tool in disciplinary control; and finally, there was significant difference  between public and private secondary schools in the use of corporal punishment.  It was recommended that the use of corporal punishment be discouraged in the  school system and there is need for principals to employ better disciplinary  techniques that would yield better results.&nbsp; </em></p>

        <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
          Discipline globally viewed could be termed to mean  training that enables an individual to develop an orderly conduct and self  control as well as self direction (Egwunyenga 2000). With reference to the  school, Adesina (1980) has described it as a situation whereby students are  taught to respect the school authorities to observe the school laws and  regulations and to maintain established standard of behaviour. This means that  respect for self and respect for others are involved (Peretomode, 1998). In the  issue of discipline, the person must be guided in his behaviour to do what is  right and good. But a situation where there is a deliberate violation of school  rules and regulations, that is, students do as they want and undo what they are  expected to do creates an undisciplined atmosphere. Some major symptoms of this  situation which have been identified by Nwankwo, Nwokafor, Ighalo and Ogunsanwo  (1987) generally include unrest, mass disobedience, truancy, bullying,  absenteeism, drug abuse, lateness, delinquency, examination malpractice,  fighting, noise making, vandalization, and violent demonstrations.</p>
        <p>History has generally shown that many societies have  become characterized by political, religious, industrial, ethnic and personal  disputes which have often been settled after violence. This culture, in the  words of Chianu (2001), &ldquo;has gradually crept into the school system&hellip;. Often  students react violently against teachers, teachers in turn vent their  frustration on students-the innocent and the guilty alike&rdquo;. For the 
        school system to achieve its desired goals discipline  must be properly enforced. This has often been done by the adoption of two  major techniques, namely &ldquo;reward&rdquo; and &ldquo;punishment&rdquo;. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;The focus of  this study is the use of punishment to instill discipline in students of  secondary schools. Punishment is an aversive stimulus, whereby an unpleasant  painful experience is applied in order to discourage a given type of  unacceptable behaviour. It is a &ldquo;traditional technique of disciplinary control  which is considered a necessary corrective measure&rdquo; (Nwankwo et al, 1987). It  is designed to point out the teacher&rsquo;s disapproval and to deal with repeated  misbehaviour capable of threatening the success of the teaching-learning  process. Saunders (2003) outlined the following as some common punishment  practices in schools &ndash; detention with some task, withdrawal of privileges,  isolation or exclusion and tidying up classrooms and picking of papers from the  play ground. Others are mental punishment such as personal criticism, ridicule  and sarcasm (Cohen and Lawrence, 1981) and verbal form which includes order to  cease, reprimand, threat (Kyriacon, 1995). Suspension and expulsion from school  are added forms of punishment.</p>
  <p>Besides the above is physical punishment, commonly  known as corporal punishment.&nbsp; Greydanus  (1992) sees this as the intentional application of physical pain as a method of  changing behaviour. It has been an accepted method of promoting good behaviour  and instilling notions of responsibility and decorum into the mischievous heads  of school children (Chianu, 2001). Corporal punishment includes a wide variety<br clear="all" />
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of methods such as hitting, slapping, punching,  kicking, pinching, kneeling, use of various objects (wooden, paddles, belts,  sticks and cane), painful body postures, knocking on the head, use of excessive  exercise drills and prevention of urine and/or stool elimination etc. In many  parts of the world, corporal punishment in school has always raised very heated  debate. In the United States and many parts of Europe, many organizations and  at different levels have fought to abolish its use (Frazier 1990) and (Poole  1991).&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In Nigeria, according to Okoh and Alvin (1983),  corporal punishment has always been a controversial issue and always difficult  to discuss rationally and objectively. Ndubisi and Uka (1981) hold that some  lay critics argue that pupils would master their subjects more effectively if  teachers gave them doses of corporal punishment and that education has fallen  in standard because corporal punishment is no longer used on erring pupils to  force them to be studious. Contrary to these views, many educationists have  argued that corporal punishment has shock and dehumanizing value (Kyricon,  1995) and capable of making the learning environment a punitive place (Pieters,  2000). Ndubisi and Uka (1981) believe that fear of corporal punishment inhibits  creativity in students, does not necessarily change the underlying wish to  misbehave, and damages teacher/student relationship. Saunders (2003) and  Purehead (2003) add that children used to corporal punishment experience  psychological harm because they become an endless cycle. Psychological problems  which have been associated with corporal punishment according to Rohner (1991),  Donnely and Straus (1994) include depression, anxiety, aggression, inferiority  complex, withdrawal syndrome and impaired self concept. Brand (2004) has argued  that effective discipline does not rely upon external application of  consequences designed to elicit compliance; that when desire drives activity,  discipline comes from within; and that when good judgment is valued over blind  obedience, the students develop a self-dedication that allows them to forgo  short-term pleasures in the pursuit of loftier goals.</p>
        <p><strong>Research objectives </strong><br />
          The focus of this study is on the use of corporal  punishment in enforcing discipline and to ascertain its effectiveness. The study  also investigates whether there is any difference in usage between public and  private secondary schools.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <strong>Research questions</strong>
        </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1. What type of punishment is frequently used in  secondary schools?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2.&nbsp; Does  corporal punishment enforce effective discipline in secondary schools?</p>
        <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br />
          1.&nbsp; There is no  significant difference between public and private secondary schools in the use  of corporal punishment as a tool of discipline. </p>
        <p><strong>Methodology</strong><br />
          The study surveyed a random sample of 326 and 189  principals, respectively of public and private secondary schools from a  population of 970. &ldquo;Corporal punishment and Disciplinary Control of Secondary  School Questionnaire (CPDCSSQ) was designed by the researcher. CPDCSSQ is a  four point Likert Scale questionnaire with 28 items. The instrument was  validated and tested for reliability and has a co-efficient of 0.82 using  product moment correlation coefficient from split-half method. </p>
        <p>The four point scale questionnaire was weighted 4,3,2  and 1 respectively. Accordingly, simple percentage/ranking and meanscores were  employed to answer the questions on frequency of use and effectiveness while  the testing of hypothesis on the views of principals of public and private  schools was done by means of Z-test statistics. </p>
        <p><strong>Results</strong><br />
          &nbsp;The  presentation of results is in line with stated research questions and  hypothesis.</p>
        <p>Research Question 1:<br />
          What is the relative frequency of the use of corporal  punishment in secondary schools?<br clear="all" />

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The responses of the 515 principals with regard to the  forms of punishment used in secondary schools are presented in table 1. These  were actually calibrated on the 4 point-Likert Scale of Strongly Agree, Agree,  Disagree and Strongly Disagree. But for the purpose of answering research  question 1, strongly agree and agree were collapsed as well as strongly  disagree and disagree. It assumed that any option that scored 50% and above  agreeing is frequently used while the highest of all which ranked 1st  is the most frequently used. Arising from the above approach, 59% agreed for  the use reprimand, 81.40% for corporal punishment, 74.7% for sweeping, 62.3%  for repairing damaged property, 77.3% for suspension, 60.4% for expulsion, and  79.4% for grass cutting. In other words, all forms with 50% and above are  frequently used. The highest percentage is that of corporal punishment ranking  1st.</p>
        <p>It therefore follows that corporal punishment is the  form of punishment that is most frequently used in the secondary schools  of&nbsp; Delta State.</p>

        <p>Table 2 presents the responses of all the principals  sampled on the effectiveness of corporal punishment in schools, indicating only  three as effective. These are flogging, painful body posture and kneeing down  which had percentage scores of 54.95%, 51.07% and 57.28% respectively. They are  considered effective for scoring above 50%.the principals rated others not  effective by reason of percentage scores below 50%. In other words, only very  few forms of corporal punishment are effective. Since majority of the forms are  not effective, one can clearly say that corporal punishment is not effective in  disciplinary control in secondary schools.</p>

        <p>The result of a test of difference in the views of  public and private secondary school principals is shown in table 3. The  decision is that their views are significantly different as the calculated z  value is 7.06 which is greater than the critical value of 1.96. The hypothesis  of no difference in views is hereby rejected.</p>
        <p><strong>Discussion</strong><br />
          The results of this study reveal that respondents  agree that there are certain forms of punishment<br clear="all" />
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>that are frequently used in secondary schools. Seven  out of the seventeen suggested forms were said to be frequently used. These  include reprimand, corporal punishment, sweeping, repairing damaged property,  suspension, expulsion, and grassing cutting. But the form that has been  established as most frequently used is corporal punishment. This could be  because of the notion that it is a &ldquo;traditional technique for disciplinary  control which is considered necessary corrective measure&rdquo; as was put forward by  Nwankwo et al (1987).</p>
        <p>However, on the forms of corporal punishment that are  effective in disciplinary control; the study identified three out of eleven to  include flogging, painful body posture and kneeling down. If only three out of  eleven are effective, it means that corporal punishment is not generally seen  as effective means of disciplinary control perhaps because people like Kyricon  (1995), Pieters (2000) Saunders (2003) and Purehead (2003) warned about the  various harms corporal punishment could cause the child. This could also  explain why private secondary schools in Delta State don&rsquo;t use it as much as  the public secondary schools as their objective in the first place is to  attract as many students as possible and not to scare them away, because the  establishment of these schools is profit driven.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />
          There is no doubt, there are some forms of punishment  that are frequently used in secondary schools and corporal punishment tops the  list as the study reveals. But this is not to say that it is effective in  disciplinary control as the study has proved. It is to be generally known that  its use is more in the public secondary schools than in private.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommendations</strong><br />
          &nbsp;The use of  corporal punishment in secondary schools be discouraged because of its harmful  effects.<strong></strong><br />
          Other less harmful disciplinary control measures such  as counselling should be frequently employed.</p>
