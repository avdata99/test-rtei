<H4>&nbsp;CONTRIBUTIONS TO REPOSITIONING NIGERIA’S EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR GLOBAL 
COMPETITIVENESS</H4>
<H4>This has mainly been done in terms of formulation of appropriate policies, 
some of the policies include:</H4>
<H4>•Minimum standards for establishment of Early Childhood Development 
Education Centres;</H4>
<H4>•Guidelines for implementation of ECD policy;</H4>
<H4>•Establishment of Resource Centre and Model Creche at FME to provide 
standards;</H4>
<H4>•National Policy on Gender in Basic Education and its Guidelines;</H4>
<H4>•National Framework on Girls and Women Education;</H4>

equality as enunciated in the 1999 Constitution;</H4>
<H4>•National policy on Albinism</H4>
<H4>•National policy on Special Needs Education;</H4>
<H4>Leadership is a critical issue in any human endeavour. &nbsp;To ensure that 
the best qualified persons are appointed Principals and Heads of schools, the 
Department came up (through the NCE) with a guideline on appointment of 
Principals;</H4>
<H4>To ensure sanity and maintain standards in the private sector involvement 
in Basic and Secondary Education, FME has compiled the Register of approved 
private schools in Nigeria. &nbsp;This would help in the monitoring and 
supervision of private schools;</H4>
<H4>The changing of the 6-3-3-4 system of Education to 1-6-3-3-4 system to 
include the one year ECCDE system to create access; and</H4>

<H4>3) &nbsp;Safe School Initiative Project&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>BACKGROUND</H4>
<H4>The North Eastern states of (Borno, Adamawa, Yobe and Gombe) and some other 
states in Nigeria have witnessed unprecedented insurgency and conflicts from 
2009 to date leading to an estimated over 2 million IDPs all over the country 
with more than 300,000 living in IDP camps. The education sector has negatively 
been affected and schooling has continuously been disrupted by Boko Haram 
insurgency. School children were killed, abducted, displaced leading to a high 
level of trauma. More than 254 schools were destroyed and facilities burnt down. 
Most public schools in Borno states have been closed since 2014 as the schools 
have been converted to IDP camps.</H4>
<H4>The Safe Schools Initiative was launched by the UN Special Envoy and former 
UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown following the terrorist group, Boko Haram attack 
and abduction of more than 200 school girls from Government Secondary school 
Chibok in Borno State, North East Nigeria in 2014.</H4>
<H4>The Steering Committee is chaired by Honourable Minister of Finance. The 
Technical Committee is chaired by the DG NEMA. Programme implementation is 
carried out by the Technical Committee. Other members of the Committees include 
NEMA, FME, and Development Partners such as DFID, UNICEF, USAID and the German 
government (GIZ), NSA and Nigeria Business Leaders</H4>
<H4>The Safe Schools Initiative in Nigeria has so far received funding from the 
Nigeria government, the Business Community in Nigeria, Foreign Governments and 
international donor agencies&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>UNICEF is supporting IDP students in various camps in Borno, Adamawa and 
Gombe States. Various intervention programmes designed in conjunction with FME 
include purchase of 40 School-in-a- box, 800 School bags to schools in camps and 
35,000 school bags with learning materials for students in IDP camps.</H4>
<H4>2069 out of 2400 IDPs have been transferred to 43 federal unity colleges in 
the North Central, North West and North East and are gradually adjusting to 
academic life in the schools.</H4>
<H4>Safe Schools Initiative and DFID in conjunction with the Nigerian Army 
Engineering Corp have conducted an assessment of the scope of work needed to 
reconstruct 30 damaged schools in the insurgency ravaged areas in the first 
instance.(Ten schools per state)</H4>
<H4>There are now &nbsp;over 7 million out-of-school children as a result of the 
insurgency.&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>USAID in conjunction with Education in Crisis and conflict network (ECCN) 
organised a workshop in Nigeria for education stakeholders in Adamawa, Borno, 
Bauchi and Yobe state &nbsp;on &nbsp;</H4>
<H4>education in crisis environments in Northern Nigeria.</H4>
<H4>PROJECT UNDER BASIC AND SECONDARY EDUCATION:</H4>
<H4>STATE EDUCATION PROGRAMME INVESTMENT PROJECT (SEPIP)</H4>
<H4>A.BRIEF ON SEPIP</H4>
<H4>1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION</H4>
<H4>The State Education Programme Investment Project (SEPIP) is a World Bank 
assisted project which is coordinated by the Federal Ministry of Education, 
Basic and Secondary Education Department, to support Education Programs 
implemented by the participating States of Anambra, Bauchi and Ekiti to improve 
the quality, access and efficiency of their education.&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>SEPIP is a pilot project (financed by a US $ 150 million Specific Investment 
Credit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which in turn disburses part of the 
funds to the three participating States through subsidiary financing agreements) 
which supports the design and implementation of educational activities in the 
three participating States at basic and secondary education level over the 
period from March 2013 to October 2017.&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support:&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>(a)need-based teacher deployment;</H4>
<H4>(b)measurement of student learning in participating States; and</H4>
<H4>(c)school level management and accountability;&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>This will contribute to, and complement, the programs and priorities of 
participating States in addressing education access, quality and efficiency 
issues, through their own funding, financing from UBEC and other government 
agencies, as well as other development partners.</H4>
<H4>The project supports five critical results which are agreed performance 
indicators captured by the five Disbursement –linked Indicators (DLIs) 
namely:</H4>
<H4>DLI 1: Teacher Deployment in Rural Areas</H4>
<H4>DLI 2: Teacher Deployment in Core Subjects</H4>
<H4>DLI 3: Assessment of Student Achievement</H4>
<H4>DLI 4: Technical and Vocational Schools</H4>
<H4>DLI 5: School-Based Management Committees (SBMCs)</H4>
<H4>PROJECT COMPONENTS:&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>The project consists of two components:&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>Component 1(US $ 125 million): A results-based financing supporting 
participating States’ education sector reform programme to improve the quality, 
access and efficiency of their education system. The results-based component 
features a relatively novel approach of disbursements conditional to achievement 
of DLIs.</H4>
<H4>Component 2 (US $ 25 million): This component provides technical assistance 
channeled through two levels: (a) State level (US $ 20 million) - supporting 
participating States towards achievement of DLIs, and the associated 
institutional capacity strengthening; and&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>(b) Federal level (US $ 5 million) – supporting the Federal Ministry of 
Education (FME) and UBEC in overall project coordination and in providing the 
enabling environment in line with national policies, and in ensuring 
sustainability and scaling-up of successful activities in other potential 
States, for instance in Edo State.</H4>
<H4>2.0KEY ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT IN THE PROJECT FROM INCEPTION</H4>
<H4>SEPIP was declared effective on August 27th, 2013.</H4>
<H4>The National launch of the project took place on 18th October, 2013.</H4>
<H4>SEPIP – was launched in Anambra on November 5th, Ekiti State on November 
21st and Bauchi State on November 29th 2013.</H4>

inaugurated on 19th December, 2013.</H4>
<H4>The NPSC is chaired by the Honourable Minister of Education and is composed 
primarily of representatives from:</H4>
<H4>i.Federal Ministry of Finance;</H4>
<H4>ii.The National Planning Commission;</H4>
<H4>iii.Participating States’ Ministries of Education;</H4>
<H4>iv.Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC); and</H4>
<H4>v.Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>The first National Project Steering Committee meeting took place on 16th 
October, 2014, chaired by the Hon. Minister of Education Mallam Ibrahim 
Shekarau.</H4>
<H4>&nbsp;3.0YEAR 1 (2013) PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS</H4>
<H4>The project is on track to meet its development objectives and the project 
implementation process has been smooth.&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>The FPSU successfully procured the services of individual consultants for 
the verification of achievement of the first year (2013) DLI targets.&nbsp;</H4>
<H4>&nbsp;Anambra</H4>
<H4>Based on independent verification, Anambra State met its Disbursement Linked 
Indicator (DLI) targets for the first year (2013), consequently, the State 
claimed full disbursement against 2013 DLIs amounting to over US $ 10 
million.</H4>
<H4>Bauchi</H4>
<H4>After independent verification and validation, it was confirmed that Bauchi 
State met all five DLIs for Year 1 (2013). The State therefore claimed full 
disbursement against 2013 DLIs amounting to over US $ 10 million.</H4>
<H4>&nbsp;Ekiti</H4>
<H4>Similarly, based on independent verification and validation, Ekiti State met 
all five DLIs for 2013 consequently, the State claimed full disbursements 
against DLIs for Year 1, amounting to over $10 million.</H4>
<H4>&nbsp;Federal Ministry of Education</H4>
<H4>The Federal Ministry of Education (FME) provides policy guidance and chairs 
the National Project Steering Committee, which is responsible for overall 
coordination and monitoring of project implementation, assisted by UBEC.</H4>
<H4>4.0YEAR 2 (2014) IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS</H4>
<H4>Implementation towards the timely achievement of the DLIs for the second 
year (2014) has largely been concluded in all the three States with the support 
of the Federal Ministry of Education. Presently, verification of the achievement 
of the DLIs for 2014 has been carried out in the three participating States by a 
firm of Independent verifiers and the verification reports, reviewed by the 
FPSU-FME have been sent to the World Bank where they are currently receiving 
attention.</H4>
<H4>&nbsp;5.0YEAR 3 (2015) IMPLEMENTATION</H4>
<H4>In certain instances, the States have carried out implementation beyond the 
targets set for the achievement of the 2014 DLIs. However, the independent 
verification of the achievement of DLIs beyond 2014 would be carried out in due 
course.</H4>
<H4>&nbsp;B.OUTLINE OF ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT IN 2014/2015</H4>
