The percentage of Australian women over 40 without children has grown in 10 years from 8% to 12% and that proportion is set to increase.<br /> </li><li>A massive 54% of women in one study believed that their careers have been affected by taking maternity leave. A further 44.1% say their salaries stall, 30.4% believe their careers take a backward step and 29.9% say they sacrificed their careers when they gave birth.<br /> </li><li>Current low fertility rates (1.86 children per woman) indicate a growing trend by women to make a choice between work and family rather than seeking both. Such choices are still necessary partly because of the failure of workplace practices to accommodate the realities of pregnancy and family responsibilities.</li></ol><p><strong>To what extent do I as an employer have to accommodate an employee's pregnancy? </strong></p><p>Employers should consider making all reasonable adjustments to the workplace to accommodate the normal effects of pregnancy. Employers need to discuss the issues with the pregnant employee to find solutions.</p><p><strong>When can I lawfully refuse to employ a pregnant applicant? </strong></p><p>An employer can lawfully refuse to employ a pregnant applicant if she is unable to adequately perform the duties required for the position; where there may be OH&amp;S issues in the workplace that cannot be resolved and if the position required the completion of a specific project and the applicant would be unable to meet the deadlines. This is unusual.</p><p><strong>My workplace has an equal opportunity policy .....isn't that enough? </strong></p><p>All employers regardless of size or industry type can benefit from developing anti-discrimination policies. Wise employers ensure that all employees are familiar with the policy and are educated about their rights and responsibilities. However, the existence of equal opportunity policies does not necessarily mean that the employer will be automatically protected in the event of a complaint of discrimination. Amongst other things, the employer should be able to show that the policies are practically and continually implemented in the workplace.</p><p><strong>If an employee of mine discriminates, then that's their problem isn't it? </strong></p><p>An employer may be vicariously liable for the actions of an employee or may be directly liable if it is found that it allowed, encouraged or contributed to the discrimination and did not have adequate policies and procedures in place to prevent and deal with discriminatory attitudes and practices in the workplace.</p><p><strong>What am I meant to do when an employee of mine is a casual, is pregnant, but doesn't have a right to maternity leave?</strong></p><p>Some casual employees qualify for unpaid maternity leave. Moreover, pregnant employees who do not qualify for maternity leave are still protected by the federal Sex Discrimination Act. Employers and employees can negotiate a fair and reasonable period of leave for those who do not qualify for maternity leave. For example the employer could provide access to other forms of leave (annual leave or unpaid leave).</p><p><strong>What if my employee returns to work after maternity leave and I just can't give her the same old job back because of changes in the workplace? </strong></p><p>An employee is generally entitled to return to the position she held prior to commencing leave or to a comparable position if her original job has ceased to exist. Employers should note that an employee may wish to return to work on a part-time basis, and some State laws specifically allow for return to part-time work after maternity leave by agreement with the employer. In some situations, an employer may be deemed to have discriminated if a reasonable request for part-time work is refused.</p></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top"><td bgcolor="#FF6600"><div align="center"><img align="absmiddle" alt="Pregnancy Guidelines" height="87" src="/sites/default/files/content/sex_discrimination/publication/pregnancy/guidelines/header.gif" width="500" /></div></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top"><td><h2>Foreward</h2><p>The Report of the National Pregnancy and Work Inquiry, entitled <a href="/sex_discrimination/publication/pregnancy/report.html"><em>Pregnant and Productive: It's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant</em></a> was published in 1999. Consultations and discussions throughout the Inquiry evidenced that pregnancy discrimination remains a matter of concern in workplaces throughout Australia.

Various laws have been put in place to ensure that pregnant women are not disadvantaged in their employment because of their pregnancy.</p><p><em>The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth)</em> ("the federal Sex Discrimination Act") makes pregnancy and potential pregnancy discrimination in employment unlawful. The principles arising from the federal Sex Discrimination Act are set out below. For more information, see the full text of the Pregnancy Guidelines.</p><p>Anti-discrimination laws are only one part of the legal framework covering pregnancy and work. Industrial relations laws, occupational health and safety ("OH&amp;S") laws, awards and agreements also deal with pregnancy issues. Employers, supervisors and employees need to understand these laws in addition to anti-discrimination laws.</p><p>This summary is intended to provide an overview of the principles involved in avoiding pregnancy discrimination at work, and may be copied and distributed to inform workplace participants of their rights and responsibilities.</p><h3>The federal Sex Discrimination Act</h3><h4>Who is covered?</h4><p>The federal Sex Discrimination Act covers all private sector and Commonwealth employers and employees. All types of employees are covered, including temporary, casual, full-time and part-time workers, apprentices and trainees. Commission agents, contract workers and partners in partnerships of six partners or more are also covered.</p><p>Employers must not discriminate. Employers can also be held liable for the actions of their managers, employees and agents such as recruitment agents, unless they take reasonable steps to prevent the discrimination. Recruitment agents and individual employees may also be held liable if they assist, aid, instruct, induce or permit an employer to discriminate.</p><table name=" A  policy requiring temporary......."><tr><td><p><strong>Case Example:</strong></p><p>A policy requiring temporary employees to work full time before being made permanent was found to indirectly discriminate. The complainant had resigned from permanent employment after taking leave to have a baby and returning to work on a part-time basis. The requirement to work full-time was not reasonable in view of evidence that the temporary employees were largely very experienced and had already completed a two year period of probation.</p><p><strong><em>Speering v Ministry for Education (1993) </em><br />EOC 92-513</strong><strong> </strong></p></td></tr></table><h4>What is pregnancy or potential pregnancy discrimination?</h4><p>Direct pregnancy and potential pregnancy discrimination takes place when a woman is treated less favourably because she is pregnant or has the potential to become pregnant.</p><p>Indirect pregnancy and potential pregnancy discrimination takes place when there is a requirement, condition or practice that disadvantages pregnant or potentially pregnant women. It will not be discriminatory if the requirement, condition or practice is reasonable in the circumstances. In assessing whether an action was reasonable, a court will consider, among other things, the disadvantage to the employee, how the disadvantage could be overcome and whether it is proportionate to what an employer sought to achieve.</p><p>Under the federal Sex Discrimination Act, the term "pregnancy" refers to the time when a woman is carrying a foetus, as well as physical characteristics of pregnancy such as having a large abdomen and tiredness. The term "potential pregnancy" refers to being capable of having children, a situation where a woman has expressed a desire to have children or when a woman is likely or is perceived to be likely to become pregnant. An act of pregnancy discrimination may also be sex discrimination or discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities, depending on the circumstances.</p><h4>When is discrimination unlawful?</h4><p>The following principles help identify how to avoid discrimination at each stage of the employment relationship.</p><table name=" An organisation refused to employ a woman as......"><tr><td><p><strong>Case example: </strong></p><p>An organisation refused to employ a woman as a trainee pilot because of the possibility of absences due to possible future pregnancy. Although the woman was rated highly at the interview, the organisation argued that it could not justify the investment in training if it was likely the woman would have children later. The organisation was found to have discriminated against the woman.</p><p><strong><em>Wardley v Ansett Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd (1984) </em><br />EOC 92-002 </strong></p></td></tr></table><h5>Recruitment</h5><p> </p><ul><li>Pregnant or potentially pregnant women must be treated the same as any other potential employee during the recruitment process.</li><li>To avoid discrimination, employers and employment agencies should seek the best applicant for the job based on merit, regardless of pregnancy or potential pregnancy.</li><li>Assumptions about the capacities of pregnant women and mothers of young children should not intrude upon the recruitment process.</li><li>Always ask questions that are job specific. Avoid asking applicants about whether they have or want to have children. Rather, ask questions about ability to travel or complete a project within the given timeframe.</li><li>If a pregnant applicant is genuinely unable to perform the requirements of the job, it is not discriminatory to refuse her the job.</li></ul><p> </p><table name="Using recruitment agents? ......."><tr><td><p><strong>Using recruitment agents? </strong></p><p>To prevent discrimination in recruitment, employers should tell recruitment agents that they expect the best job candidates to be interviewed, irrespective of pregnancy or potential pregnancy.</p></td></tr></table><br /><table name=" A convention supervisor"><tr><td><p><strong>Case example: </strong></p><p>A convention supervisor was transferred to a telephonist position (at the same salary) because she was pregnant. Her employer said that it did not look good for a pregnant woman to be carrying film projectors and raised other OH&amp;S issues. Although the employee's salary remained the same, the employer was found to have discriminated, as it had demoted the employee because of her pregnancy. The Tribunal was also satisfied that the employee was able to carry out her duties safely.</p><p><strong><em>Duggan v Shore Inn Pty Ltd (1992) </em><br />EOC 92-457 </strong></p></td></tr></table><h5>Employment</h5><p> </p><ul><li>Pregnant or potentially pregnant employees should be treated in a fair and equitable manner. Employers should not reduce an employee's terms and conditions or deny other benefits on the basis of pregnancy or potential pregnancy.</li><li>Where necessary, employers should make all reasonable adjustments to the workplace to accommodate the normal effects of pregnancy. Employers need to discuss the issues with the pregnant employee to find solutions.</li><li>Where medical issues are associated with a pregnancy or legitimate OH&amp;S issues arise, employers should make reasonable adjustments in the workplace to allow pregnant employees to continue to work.</li><li>It is not discriminatory to accommodate an employee who is pregnant.</li><li>In limited cases where medical or OH&amp;S issues cannot be resolved, an employer may need to temporarily transfer a pregnant employee.</li><li>Constant references to an employee's pregnancy, touching her stomach and badgering her about whether she is "really" planning to come back to work are likely to amount to discrimination.</li><li>When an employee has had her position adjusted in some way because of her pregnancy, her benefits should remain the same, although her salary may alter if her hours decrease.</li></ul><p> </p><table name="Simple measures can prevent discrimination......."><tr><td><p><strong>Simple measures can prevent discrimination. </strong></p><p>Depending on the workplace, simple measures to accommodate pregnancy can include:</p><blockquote><p>- adequate toilet breaks;<br /><br />- providing larger uniforms or not requiring pregnant women to wear uniforms;<br /><br />- providing seating.</p></blockquote><p>In some cases an assessment of exposure to hazardous materials will be required and managed in a non-discriminatory way.</p></td></tr></table><h5>Leave</h5><p> </p><ul><li>Minimum maternity leave provisions are set in industrial relations laws, awards and agreements. Employee entitlements and notice requirements should be checked as they differ from workplace to workplace.</li><li>Minimum leave entitlements for non-casual employees include:<br />- up to 12 months unpaid maternity leave after 12 months service; and<br />- access to sick leave when ill during pregnancy.</li><li>Some casuals qualify for unpaid maternity leave.</li><li>Pregnant employees who do not qualify for maternity leave are still protected by the federal Sex Discrimination Act. Employers and employees can negotiate a fair and reasonable period of leave for those who do not qualify for maternity leave.</li><li>Employers and co-workers should not assume that pregnant employees will automatically take 12 months maternity leave, as women take varying amounts. Some women take no maternity leave at all, preferring to utilise paid annual leave or long service leave.</li><li>Generally, employees are entitled to return to their former position after maternity leave.</li></ul><p> </p><table name="Employers can help discrimination by......."><tr><td><p><strong>Employers can help prevent discrimination by:</strong></p><blockquote><p>- Advising pregnant employees of their rights and responsibilities in relation to maternity and sick leave.<br /><br />- Having policies and procedures for managing maternity leave, including how the employee and employer can keep in touch during the leave.<br /><br />- Developing an information kit on maternity leave for employees and managers.</p></blockquote></td></tr></table><br /><table name="Restructuring?......."><tr><td><p><strong>Restructuring?</strong></p><p>Remember to advise and consult your employees on maternity leave if the organisation is undergoing a restructure. Redundancy arrangements should be offered to an employee on maternity leave in the same way it is offered to other employees. Just because an employee is pregnant or on maternity leave, does not mean she will want to be made redundant.</p></td></tr></table><h5>Dismissal and retrenchment</h5><p> </p><ul><li>An employer cannot dismiss or retrench an employee because she is pregnant or has the potential to become pregnant, even if this reason is only one of the reasons for her dismissal.</li><li>An employer may dismiss or retrench an employee if the decision is based on reasons other than pregnancy such as:<br />- genuine financial or reasons;<br />- poor or inadequate work performance; or<br />- serious or wilful misconduct.<br /> </li></ul><p> </p><table height="186" name=" Following a restructure........"><tr><td><p><strong>Case example: </strong></p><p>Following a restructure, an employee was transferred to new duties on return from maternity leave without consultation. The Hearing Commissioner found that the complainant's pregnancy was a factor in the change of duties. This was because the pregnancy led to her being on maternity leave and the restructuring occurred without consultation during this time. The conduct of the employer was found to be unlawful sex discrimination.</p><p><strong><em>Gibbs v Australian Wool Corporation (1990)</em></strong><br /><strong>EOC 92-327 </strong></p></td></tr></table><h4>How can pregnancy friendly policies help?</h4><p>Effective anti-discrimination policies can limit employer liability in the event of a complaint, as they demonstrate the employer taking steps to prevent acts of discrimination.</p><p>Policies aimed at achieving a balance between work and family life can also benefit organisations through, for example, increased productivity and staff retention.</p><p>Writing a policy need not be difficult. Start with a document explaining what constitutes pregnancy and potential pregnancy discrimination, stating that it will not be tolerated and inform all workplace participants of the action that will be taken if discrimination occurs. A good policy will also include information about maternity leave and how the organisation manages pregnancy related issues such as OH&amp;S.</p><p>Once a policy is developed, it should not be left to languish on a file or intranet. For effective implementation and employer protection, the policy must be well communicated. Education of all parties is required if anti-discrimination laws and the organisation's policy are to be adhered to.</p><p><strong>Remember that the facts of each situation will determine whether unlawful discrimination has occurred.

The Guidelines refer to this as accommodation or adjustment. For example, employers may need to accommodate pregnant employees by providing seating where this will assist employees to continue working.</p><p>Pregnancy discrimination often occurs because people make automatic assumptions about pregnant employees requiring different treatment. However, most pregnant employees carry out their work in the same way they did before they were pregnant.</p><p>The federal Sex Discrimination Act protects employers who provide benefits to women who are pregnant.

Potential pregnancy discrimination in recruitment can occur when a woman is not given an opportunity to apply for a position, or is not offered a position because she may become pregnant in the future.</p><p>Recruitment processes include:</p><p> </p><blockquote><ul><li>seeking applications;</li><li>standard application forms;</li><li>any system used for selection, including psychological testing, interviews, group assessments, bonding exercises etc;</li><li>the conduct of selection processes;</li><li>short listing applicants; and</li><li>the final selection and hiring of successful applicants.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Recruitment processes should ensure all potential applicants understand the specific requirements of the job.</p><p>Applicants should be selected on merit-based attributes such as skills, experience, qualifications and aptitude. If an applicant is less qualified or is unable to perform the pre-determined requirements of the position, it is not discriminatory to refuse her the position. In only very limited cases will pregnancy have any effect on an applicant's capacity to carry out the requirements of the position. Pregnancy is a normal, healthy physical condition.</p><p>Employers must not discriminate against existing employees when filling internal positions. Pregnant and potentially pregnant employees must not be discriminated against when decisions about promotions, transfers and existing or new positions with the same employer are being made.</p><h3><a id="when" name="when"></a>2.2 When it is not discriminatory to refuse employment</h3><p>In very limited situations it may not be discriminatory to refuse to employ, promote or transfer an applicant who is pregnant. For example:</p><p> </p><blockquote><ul><li>if an applicant is not able to adequately perform the duties required for the position due to a medical condition; <a href="#f2_7">[7]</a></li><li>where there are OH&amp;S issues in the workplace that cannot be resolved due to the pregnancy; or</li><li>if the position requires completion of a specific project and the applicant would be unable to meet the absolute timeframes of the project.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Before an employer refuses an applicant employment on the basis of OH&amp;S or medical issues the employer should proceed with caution. Obtaining a medical report and contacting the relevant State or Territory OH&amp;S organisation <a href="#f2_8">[8]</a>, could assist in avoiding discrimination. All reasonable options for accommodating the applicant should first be considered.</p><p><a href="#3_what_can">Click here to get more information on when it is not discriminatory to refuse employment.</a></p><p>In NSW, anti-discrimination legislation allows an employer to discriminate against a pregnant woman during recruitment, in limited circumstances. <a href="#f2_9">[9]</a> The federal Sex Discrimination Act does not provide an exemption of this type and an employer in NSW may be the subject of a complaint under the federal law <a href="#f2_10">[10],</a> even if they are complying with the NSW law.</p><h3><a id="2_3" name="2_3"></a>2.3 Who is liable for discrimination in recruitment?</h3><p>Employers and employment agencies may both be liable for discrimination in recruitment.</p><h4><a id="2_agencies" name="2_agencies"></a>Employment and recruitment agencies</h4><p>Employment and recruitment agencies are liable for discriminatory hiring practices even if they are acting on behalf of, or following the directions of, a client. <a href="#f2_11">[11]</a></p><h4><a id="employers" name="employers"></a>Employers</h4><p>When contracting an agency to advertise, search for and select prospective employees, an employer would be well advised to require the agency to adhere to and adopt non-discriminatory processes. This will help employers avoid being held jointly liable with the agency for any acts of discrimination during the recruitment process. An employer may also be liable for the discriminatory actions of its employees or agents who recruit others on behalf of the employer, unless the employer took all <em><strong>reasonable steps</strong></em> to prevent the employee or agent from doing the discriminatory acts. <a href="#f2_12">[12]</a></p><p><em><strong>Reasonable steps</strong></em> might incluIde the employer making it clear that the best applicants for the position are to be short listed irrespective of pregnancy or potential pregnancy.

It is also an offence to cause or permit such an advertisement or notice to be published or displayed. <a href="#f2_13">[13]</a></p><p>An advertisement or notice includes publicly or privately distributed notices in a wide variety of forms and by a wide variety of mediums, including advertisements placed on the Internet or notice boards. <a href="#f2_14">[14]</a></p><p>At every stage of recruitment advertising, all parties involved may be held liable for discriminatory advertisements, including:</p><p> </p><blockquote><ul><li>the <em><strong>employer</strong></em> who authorises the terms of the advertisement;</li><li>the <em><strong>recruitment agency</strong></em> that writes and places the advertisement; and</li><li>the <strong>newspaper</strong> or other medium that publishes or displays the advertisement.</li></ul></blockquote>There are also State and Territory anti-discrimination laws that cover discrimination in advertising. <a href="#f2_15">[15]</a><h3><a id="2_5" name="2_5"></a>2.5 Job applications</h3><p>Generally, job applicants are not required by law to include information regarding their sex, age, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, in job applications. If such information is provided, employers should not use it to evaluate applicants. <a href="#f2_16">[16]</a> Sound recruitment practices generally do not include the need to ask for this type of information and not doing so removes any suspicion of discriminatory use.</p><h3><a id="2.6" name="2.6"></a>2.6 Questions at interview</h3><p>Employers need to ensure that interviews and selection processes are not based on, or influenced by, stereotypical assumptions about pregnant employees or women who may potentially become pregnant. For example, employers should not make assumptions about the length of maternity leave that individual women want, or that women with young children would not be able to travel extensively to undertake job commitments.</p><p>To avoid discrimination, sound management may include:</p><p> </p><blockquote><ul><li>asking only those questions relevant to the inherent requirements of the job; and</li><li>developing a series of questions that can be asked of each applicant, irrespective of whether the applicant is male or female.</li></ul></blockquote><table height="484" name="Questions at interview - Workplace examples"><tr><td><h3><a id="examples" name="examples"></a>Workplace examples:</h3><h4>Short and fixed term contracts</h4><p>When recruiting for a fixed-term time-bound project, such as hiring an accountant to implement a new accounts system by the end of the financial year or employing an events manager for an upcoming conference, it would be appropriate to ask the applicant if they have any obligations that would prevent them from undertaking the duties in the period required.</p><h5><em>Inappropriate question: Are you pregnant? </em></h5><h5><em>Appropriate question: Will you be available to complete the project within the deadlines that have been set? </em></h5><h4>Jobs with extensive travel</h4><p>It should not be assumed that a pregnant employee could not be employed in a position requiring extensive travel. The information that could be properly sought by the employer is, for example, the applicant's ability to effectively communicate with people in different regions, including any possible limits on the applicant's ability to travel. The employer should consider options that can accommodate temporary inability to travel, including telephone and video-conferencing.</p><h5><em>Inappropriate question: Are you planning to start a family? </em></h5><h5><em>Appropriate question: The position will require regular travel for periods ranging from overnight to one week.

However most pregnant employees carry out their work in the same way as they did before they were pregnant.</p><p>It is the responsibility of employers to treat pregnant and potentially pregnant employees in a fair and equitable manner that does not discriminate against them. This includes providing pregnant and potentially pregnant employees with the same basic terms and conditions of employment and the same benefits as they would receive if they were not pregnant. It is also the employers' responsibility to ensure other employees treat pregnant and potentially pregnant women in a non-discriminatory way.</p><p>Generally this means that an employee cannot be:</p><p>" transferred; " demoted; " made part-time if she was full-time or vice versa; " made casual if she was permanent; " given reduced hours of work or increased hours of work; " given less skilled or less demanding work; " denied education or training; " denied promotion; or " denied other employment benefits or opportunities</p><p>because of her pregnancy or potential pregnancy without the agreement of the employee.</p><p>There are a small number of cases when medical issues associated with pregnancy may require an employer to make some adjustment to work arrangements to allow a pregnant employee to work safely and efficiently. Making these adjustments will help ensure that there is no discrimination against an employee because she is pregnant.</p><h3><a id="3_2" name="3_2"></a>3.2 Adjustments for employees who are pregnant</h3><p>Some women experience physical effects such as tiredness and nausea during certain stages of pregnancy. In most cases, this does not prevent women performing their work. To avoid discriminating on the basis of pregnancy, employers are encouraged to accommodate the normal effects of pregnancy in the workplace.</p><p>Employers should note that anti-discrimination legislation in Tasmania and the Northern Territory has provisions that deal specifically with the accommodation of pregnant employees. <a href="#f3_17">[17]</a></p><table name="Workplace Examples"><tr><td><p><strong>Workplace examples: </strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have an obligation to provide seating? </em></strong></p><p>Providing seating is a simple way to accommodate the needs of some pregnant employees. Failure to provide seating when the work can be reasonably performed sitting down, may be discriminatory. It may also endanger the health of the employee and her unborn child.</p><p><strong><em>What if an employee requires additional toilet breaks? </em></strong></p><p>The physical changes pregnant women experience may mean that some women need increased access to toilet breaks. Denying a pregnant employee adequate toilet breaks is likely to be discrimination.</p><p><strong><em>Can I alter rosters or hours of work? </em></strong></p><p>In most situations an employee who is pregnant will be able to work the same rosters and hours as an employee who is not pregnant. Rosters should not be altered because of pregnancy unless there is a specific reason, such as a pregnancy related illness. Nor should the pregnant employee's hours or normal shifts be altered, unless done in consultation with, and with the legitimate agreement of, the employee. A medical report supporting the changes, stating the reason why the existing rosters cannot be worked and detailing the nature, amount and times that work can be performed, given the circumstances of the pregnancy, is often helpful.</p><p><strong><em>Do I need to provide uniforms for pregnant employees? </em></strong></p><p>Where an employer requires an employee to wear a uniform, uniforms should be provided in sizes sufficient to accommodate pregnancy. Alternatively, an employer may consider waiving the requirement to wear a uniform for the period when suitably sized uniforms are unavailable. Where an inability to wear the uniform causes detriment to the employee, such as denial of access to particular duties, sound workplace management would ensure that this situation is properly addressed to prevent discrimination.</p><p><strong><em>Is there an issue with drinking water? </em></strong></p><p>The body temperature of pregnant women tends to increase more rapidly than that of women who are not pregnant. It is important that pregnant women have access to drinking water while working.</p></td></tr></table><h4><a id="3_what_if" name="3_what_if"></a>What if an employer fails to make appropriate adjustments for employees who are pregnant?</h4><p>An employment condition, requirement or practice that unreasonably fails to accommodate pregnancy may disadvantage pregnant employees and therefore constitute indirect discrimination under the federal Sex Discrimination Act. <a href="#f3_18">[18]</a> While the requirement or practice may appear to be non-discriminatory, ultimately it could have the effect of disadvantaging pregnant employees. The fact that an employer did not intend to discriminate is not relevant under the federal Sex Discrimination Act, it is the impact of the requirement or practice that is assessed.</p><p><a href="#reasonableness">Click here for a definition of reasonableness and case examples. </a></p><p>General advice for employers is to consider all reasonable options when accommodating pregnant employees and to be prepared to discuss these options with employees to find individual solutions.</p><p>There is no single answer as to what is required to reach a non-discriminatory outcome as it depends on individual circumstances. Employer decisions taken in consultation and cooperation with the pregnant employee will usually assist in a reasonable outcome. Remember, no two pregnancies are the same and people need to be managed as individuals. Do not make assumptions about what a pregnant woman wants or needs. It is always better to ask her.</p><h4><a id="3_what_can" name="3_what_can"></a>What if an employee who is pregnant cannot be accommodated?</h4><p>It is unlikely that an employee cannot be accommodated. However, problems may occur if there are medical issues in addition to the pregnancy, or where there are particular OH&amp;S issues in the workplace.</p><h4><a id="3_pregnancy" name="3_pregnancy"></a>Pregnancy discrimination and medical issues</h4><p>If a pregnant employee has medical issues associated with her pregnancy, such as fatigue or high blood pressure, the employer should consider the medical issues and the need to accommodate them in the broader context of discrimination law. This may involve seeking medical advice, consulting with the employee and acting on the medical advice in a non-discriminatory way.</p><p>There is further information on <a href="#3_sick">sick leave here</a> and <a href="#3_role">medical advice here.</a></p><h4><a id="3_OHS" name="3_OHS"></a>Pregnancy discrimination and OH&amp;S</h4><p>When complying with the responsibility to accommodate pregnancy at work, employers must be aware of OH&amp;S requirements, as well as the prohibition of discrimination against pregnant employees. <a href="#fa1_19">[19]</a></p><p>Where OH&amp;S risks to pregnant employees cannot be controlled or eliminated, the employer may need to transfer a pregnant employee to an alternative job within the organisation.</p><p><a href="#append_c">See Appendix C for further discussion of OH&amp;S and pregnancy.</a></p><p>Under the federal Sex Discrimination Act, any transfer must be done in a way that does not discriminate against a pregnant employee. For example, the transfer should not result in loss of opportunities for promotion, training, financial loss, extra travel time or exposing the pregnant employee to harassment by fellow workers.</p><p>Maternity leave provisions under some State and federal laws, awards or agreements require an employer to consider such a transfer on the production of a medical certificate. <a href="#f3_20">[20]</a> These laws also generally provide that a woman be returned to her original job, not the job she was transferred to while pregnant, upon her return from maternity leave. <a href="#f3_21">[21]</a></p><h4><a id="3_role" name="3_role"></a>The role of medical advice in managing pregnancy at work</h4><p>Nurses, health care workers, midwives, general practitioners and obstetricians, among others, can provide advice about managing pregnancy in the workplace. In-house medical advisers and doctors can also provide general advice, however employees should also seek independent advice.</p><p>Medical certificates are usually required when an employee needs to transfer to safer or lighter duties, to reduce working hours, or where special maternity leave is required. <a href="#22">[22]</a> The federal Sex Discrimination Act states that it is not unlawful to request or require a person who is pregnant to provide medical information concerning the pregnancy. <a href="#f3_23">[23]</a></p><p>Of concern to some employers is the inadequacy or limited nature of the information provided in medical certificates. Of particular concern is the phrase 'light duties'. Employers are encouraged to request that medical certificates address the actual duties that would be appropriate for the pregnant employee.</p><p>An employee should discuss with her medical adviser the detail required in a medical certificate. To assist this process, employers may consider developing a simple information sheet to obtain the relevant information.</p><p>Information sheets could contain information about current duties, hazards particular to the workplace or the work being performed, and seek any relevant information about the particular circumstances of the pregnancy and possible alternative duties.Information sheets should be compiled in a non-discriminatory manner, concentrating on OH&amp;S criteria.</p><p>The limits of workplace adjustment There are, on very rare occasions, circumstances where a pregnant employee can no longer perform her job even after workplace adjustments and there are no alternative tasks or available transfers. In such circumstances, the employer can provide extended leave with or without pay or the pregnant employee could commence unpaid maternity leave early.</p><p>It may, after careful consideration, be lawful to terminate the employment contract where the pregnant employee is no longer able to meet the terms and conditions of the position.<a href="#f3_24">[24]</a> It is very rare for these circumstances to arise. If such a situation did arise, sound management practice would ensure that there was adequate documentation to demonstrate that no other alternative options existed and that all requirements of anti-discrimination, industrial relations and OH&amp;S legislation had been met. Employers would be well advised to discuss the situation and appropriate responses with a specialist adviser or relevant government agency.</p><p><a href="#contact">Click here to view the Contact List.</a></p><table name="Case Examples"><tr><td height="339"><h4>Case example:</h4><p>A kennel assistant alleged she was discriminated against when she fell pregnant and resigned because her employer could not provide alternative duties that did not involve working with cats.

Dismissal in these circumstances is likely to be unlawful under the federal Sex Discrimination Act.</p><p>Therefore while some pregnant employees may not qualify for maternity leave, employers at a minimum must not discriminate unlawfully and may consider:</p><p> </p><ul><li>providing access to other forms of leave (such as annual leave or leave without pay);</li><li>discussing a reasonable period of absence having regard to the needs of both the employer and the employee; and</li><li>if leave is refused, providing the employee with reasons why the employer is unable to grant leave without pay or why other options are impracticable.</li></ul><p> </p><h4><a id="3_notice" name="3_notice"></a>How much notice does the employee need to provide before taking maternity leave?</h4><p>Federal, State and Territory industrial relations laws, awards and agreements determine the minimum notice for maternity leave.</p><p>The federal Workplace Relations Act 1996 requires:</p><p> </p><ul><li>notice of the employee's intention to take maternity leave ten weeks prior to the estimated date of birth;</li><li>a medical certificate stating the expected date of birth and an application for maternity leave at least four weeks prior to the first day of maternity leave; and</li><li>a statutory declaration saying the employee will be the child's primary caregiver and will not do anything inconsistent with her contract of employment. <a href="#f3_27">[27]</a></li></ul><p> </p><p>The federal <em>Workplace Relations Act 1996</em> also states that the required notice of intention to take maternity leave, the provision of documents and application for leave will not be strictly applied if it is not reasonably practicable for an employee to give this notice, for example, if a child is born prematurely. <a href="#f3_28">[28]</a></p><p>Similar provisions exist in other industrial relations laws, awards and agreements, although they vary slightly. <a href="#f3_29">[29]</a> The applicable provisions most beneficial to employees should always be applied.</p><p>Generally, there is no obligation for a pregnant employee to take maternity leave if she chooses not to. <a href="#f3_30">[30]</a> Accumulated annual leave or other forms of leave may be used instead of, or in conjunction with, maternity leave, subject to the usual requirements for taking such leave.</p><h4><a id="3_medical_cert" name="3_medical_cert"></a>Does a medical certificate have to be provided?</h4><p>Under industrial relations laws, awards and agreements, an employee planning to take any maternity leave must provide a doctor's certificate confirming the pregnancy and the expected date of birth, prior to taking the maternity leave. <a href="#f3_31">[31]</a></p><p>Medical certificates may also be required when an employee requests to transfer to safer or light duties, or to reduce work hours due to a medical condition related to pregnancy, or where sick leave or special maternity leave is taken.</p><h4><a id="3_prior" name="3_prior"></a>Can an employer require a pregnant employee to commence maternity leave prior to the birth?</h4><p>Some laws, awards and agreements allow employers to request employees who have applied for maternity leave to commence leave before the birth of the child. <a href="#f3_32">[32]</a> Usually this arises if it can be demonstrated that continuing to work poses a genuine OH&amp;S risk.</p><p>If commencing maternity leave disadvantages an employee, the employer must be able to demonstrate that a thorough examination of alternative duties, options for job modification and availability of positions for transfer have been undertaken in consultation with the employee. It would be most unwise, even if State legislation allows it, to require an employee to commence maternity leave early if she had a medical certificate that stated that she was able to continue working.</p><h4><a id="3_after" name="3_after"></a>Can an employer require an employee to take maternity leave after the birth?</h4><p>Some laws, awards and agreements require employees who are taking maternity leave to take a mandatory period of leave after the birth of the child. <a href="#f3_33">[33]</a> If an employee is disadvantaged by this requirement a complaint under the federal Sex Discrimination Act could still be made. The award or agreement prescribing the mandatory period of maternity leave would then be referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ("the AIRC") for review. <a href="#f3_34">[34] </a></p><p><a href="#fa3_3_alternative">For more information about alternative forums for complaint click here. </a></p><h3><a id="3_sick" name="3_sick"></a>Sick leave</h3><h4>Using sick leave during pregnancy</h4><p>Pregnant employees who become ill during pregnancy have the same sick leave rights and entitlements as well as the same responsibilities as other employees.</p><p>Pregnant employees are entitled to use sick leave to attend regular prenatal medical appointments or special appointments associated with pregnancy complications, subject to the same conditions that apply to sick leave generally. Any restriction on the use of sick leave to attend these appointments, or unreasonable restrictions on actually attending such appointments could amount to discriminatory treatment under the federal Sex Discrimination Act, or a possible breach of an award or a certified agreement. <a href="#f3_35">[35]</a></p><p>Some laws, awards and agreements make provision for unpaid special maternity leave prior to the birth where a medical practitioner certifies it to be necessary. <a href="#f3_36">[36]</a> Special maternity leave is taken instead of, or in conjunction with, paid sick leave and in most cases employees can choose which form of leave to use.</p><p>Where sick leave is limited, it is a good idea for pregnant employees, in consultation with their employers, to take the necessary leave in hourly increments rather than whole days. If sick leave runs out and a pregnant employee is still unwell, employers may consider exploring other leave arrangements, such as annual leave, time off in lieu, long service leave or leave without pay in place of sick leave.</p><h4>Using sick leave during maternity leave</h4><p>The birth of a child does not, by itself, constitute an illness and does not provide an entitlement to sick leave. However, in some circumstances a pregnant employee or an employee who has just given birth may also be sick. The availability of sick leave in this situation will depend largely on the relevant law, award or agreement covering the given workplace and the pregnant employee's medical certificate. It also depends on how closely the illness and the pregnancy are connected.</p><table name="Case example"><tr><td height="145"><p><strong>Case example: </strong></p><p>In 1999, the South Australian Industrial Relations Commission decided that if a pregnant employee becomes ill and, as a result, the child is born prematurely, the employee might be able to claim sick leave until the child is able to leave hospital, and then commence maternity leave.</p><p><strong><em>SA Commission for Catholic Schools v Association of Non-Government Education Employees SA (1999) 88 IR 130 </em></strong></p></td></tr></table><h3><a id="3_4" name="3_4"></a>3.4 Return to work after maternity leave</h3><p>Under industrial relations laws, awards and agreements as well as the federal Sex Discrimination Act, an employee is generally entitled to return to the position she held prior to commencing leave or to a comparable available position if her original job has ceased to exist. However, where the pregnancy has required some temporary adjustment or accommodation to the normal role prior to commencing maternity leave (such as part-time employment or change in shifts), the employee is entitled to return to the position or job she held immediately prior to the temporary accommodation.</p><p>An employee returning from maternity leave may also wish to work part-time or on a job share basis. Awards, agreements, and some State laws specifically allow for a return to part-time work after maternity leave by agreement with the employer. In some situations, an employer may be deemed to have made a discriminatory decision if a reasonable request for part-time work is refused.</p><table name="Sex Discrimination Commissioner Comment"><tr><td height="74"><strong><em>Sex Discrimination Commissioner Comment: </em></strong><em>There is a growth of precedent in this area.

Examples of inappropriate behaviour include constant references to the pregnancy, touching the employee's stomach, badgering the employee about her ability to cope with the workload, or continually questioning the employee about whether she 'really' intends to come back to work. Where such conduct constitutes less favourable treatment of the pregnant employee, it will amount to unlawful discrimination under the federal Sex Discrimination Act. <a href="/sex_discrimination/pregnancy/guidelines/append_a.html">See Appendix A for further information. </a> Employers could be liable for their employees' inappropriate conduct unless they took reasonable steps to prevent it. <a href="#f3_37">[37] </a></p><p>Harassment of pregnant women may also amount to sexual harassment for the purposes of the federal Sex Discrimination Act, where the conduct is of a sexual nature, for example, touching a pregnant woman's abdomen or breasts. <a href="#f3_38">[38]</a> In cases of sexual harassment the person who harasses may be found to be directly liable. <a href="#f3_39">[39]</a> An employer may also be vicariously liable for sexual harassment unless they have taken all reasonable steps to prevent the harassment. <a href="#f3_40">[40] </a></p><p><a href="#append_b">Appendix B provides advice to employers on how to take adequate steps to prevent discrimination and harassment of pregnant employees. </a></p><h3><a id="3.6" name="3.6"></a>3.6 Other issues</h3><h4><a id="3_miscarriage" name="3_miscarriage"></a>Miscarriage, still birth or the death of a newborn child</h4><p>Discrimination against employees who suffer a miscarriage, a still birth or the death of a newborn child is likely to be unlawful under the pregnancy discrimination provisions of the federal Sex Discrimination Act. <a href="#f3_41">[41] </a></p><p>Where a pregnancy has ended due to a miscarriage, or an employee has suffered a still birth or the death of a newborn child, employers can generally cancel maternity leave if it has not commenced, or limit the leave if it has already commenced. <a href="#f3_42">[42]</a> However, employees are usually entitled to special maternity leave or sick leave in such circumstances, subject to the provision of a medical certificate. <a href="#f3_43">[43]</a></p><p>Extended leave after a miscarriage, a still birth or the death of a newborn child is in some cases left to the discretion of the employer. <a href="#f3_44">[44]</a> However, any discrimination, including the denial of entitlements, may be found to be unlawful under the federal Sex Discrimination Act.</p><h4><a id="3_termination" name="3_termination"></a>Pregnancy termination</h4><p>Discrimination against employees who terminate a pregnancy may be unlawful under the pregnancy discrimination provisions of the federal Sex Discrimination Act. <a href="#f3_45">[45] </a></p><p>Employees who terminate a pregnancy are entitled to access their sick leave, subject to meeting eligibility requirements under the relevant legislation, award or agreement. Extended leave after a termination is at the discretion of an employer.</p><h4><a id="3_fertility" name="3_fertility"></a>Fertility treatment</h4><p>Discrimination against employees on the basis that they are undertaking fertility treatment, such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), may be found to be unlawful under the potential pregnancy discrimination provisions of the federal Sex Discrimination Act. This may include, for example, denial of training or promotional opportunities on the basis that the employee may become pregnant. <a href="#f3_46">[46] </a></p><p>In considering whether the conduct would be discriminatory for the purposes of the federal Sex Discrimination Act, the marital status of the employee in question is irrelevant to the situation.</p><h4><a id="adoption" name="adoption"></a>Adoption</h4><p>The provisions of the federal Sex Discrimination Act relating to pregnancy discrimination do not cover adoption. However, some types of discrimination against employees who have adopted or plan to adopt children could be unlawful discrimination on other grounds. <a href="#f3_47">[47]</a> It would be wise for employers to adopt non-discriminatory practices relating to recruitment, selection, terms and conditions of employment and termination of employment when managing employees who are adopting children.</p><hr /><p><a id="f3_17" name="f3_17"></a>17.

Example"><tr><td><h4>Case example: Indirect discrimination and the requirement to work full-time</h4><p>A solicitor was nominated for advancement to contract partner. She then advised the firm that she was pregnant. In the following month her arrangements for maternity leave were agreed; she would take three months off work after the birth and then work three days per week on her return. Shortly before her scheduled return several of the firm's partners met with the solicitor and suggested that she reduce her practice and give up a number of her case files. She did not agree to this proposal and the firm then refused her request for a temporary replacement. She returned to work, working three days from the office and two days from home. She subsequently received an unfavourable performance assessment that noted "I do not believe you can run a practice and service clients three days per week." Her partnership contract was not renewed.</p><p>The solicitor's complaint was that the statement concerning part-time work was in effect a requirement that she must work full-time to maintain her position and that such a requirement was indirect discrimination on the ground of sex. The firm responded that full-time work was inherent to the position. The Hearing Commissioner found that the requirement to work full-time would inevitably disadvantage women practitioners, especially those aspiring to be partners and that the requirement to work full-time imposed on the solicitor in order to maintain her position was not reasonable in the circumstances. The Hearing Commissioner also noted the importance of the firm having clearly defined maternity leave and part-time work policies to ensure minimum standards of fair and equal treatment, including matters such as changes to personnel or to the practice and decisions about recruitment.</p><p><strong><em>Hickie v Hunt &amp; Hunt (1998) EOC 92-910 </em></strong></p></td></tr></table><p> </p><table name="Case Example"><tr><td><h4>Case example: Indirect discrimination and the requirement for permanent employment</h4><p>The complainant, a teacher, claimed that the requirement for long standing temporary teachers to work one year full-time "probation" in order to obtain permanency was discriminatory. The complainant had taken leave to have a baby and then resigned and worked as a part-time teacher and a relief teacher. In this capacity, she was not entitled to maternity leave when she became pregnant a second time and she left work. She later began teaching part-time, as she was not able to work full-time. The complainant gave evidence about the disadvantages of temporary status including lack of continuity and security of employment, no annual 'performance appraisal' and the preference for permanent staff when professional development opportunities were available. She said permanent employment had the advantages of continuity of employment, entitlement to apply for leave without pay, study leave, plus employment within the central office and promotion, as well as higher status within the school's staff.</p><p>The Tribunal found the "probation" requirement not reasonable in view of evidence that temporary teachers were largely very experienced and highly skilled and had already completed two years probation after graduation. The Tribunal found that the requirement was unreasonable in the circumstances and referred to the less favourable position of temporary teachers and the stress the complainant experienced as a result of the discriminatory policy and the comparative advancement of her contemporaries. The Tribunal awarded financial compensation to the complainant.</p><p><strong><em>Speering v Ministry of Education (1993) EOC 92-513 </em></strong></p></td></tr></table><h3><a id="fa1_1_5" name="fa1_1_5"></a>1.5 Employers' liability for others' conduct</h3><p>Employers can be held liable for discrimination committed by their employees in the course of employment. The federal Sex Discrimination Act makes employers and principals liable for the conduct of their employees or agents. <a href="#fa1_15">[15]</a> This is referred to as vicarious liability. Vicarious liability means that if an employee harasses or discriminates against a co-worker, client or customer, the employer can be held legally responsible and may be liable for damages.</p><p>The vicarious liability provisions in the federal Sex Discrimination Act also provide employers with a defence. Vicarious liability can be minimised if an employer can show that 'all reasonable steps' were taken to prevent the harassment or discrimination. To reduce or avoid liability, employers could implement policies and practices to minimise the risk of unlawful workplace behaviour occurring and informing staff about established procedures to address complaints of discrimination.</p><h4>Avoiding vicarious liability</h4><p>Employers can limit their vicarious liability and should note three important principles that have emerged from vicarious liability cases:</p><ul><li>'reasonable steps' must be active, preventative measures;</li><li>the obligation to prove that 'all reasonable steps' were taken rests with the employer; and</li><li>lack of awareness that the discrimination or harassment was occurring is not a defence for employers.</li></ul><p>The Federal Court has indicated reasonable steps for employers to take to minimise vicarious liability under the federal Sex Discrimination Act. While this information was provided in the context of a sexual harassment matter, the principles apply equally to pregnancy and potential pregnancy discrimination.</p><table name="Case Example"><tr><td><h4><a id="ref2" name="ref2"></a>Case example: Reasonable steps</h4><p>An employee alleged sexual harassment by a co-worker. The employer argued that reasonable steps to prevent the harassment had been taken.</p><p>The Court said "it may be more difficult for a small employer, with few employees, to put in place a satisfactory sexual harassment regime than for a large employer with skilled human resources personnel and formal training procedures. But the [federal Sex Discrimination] Act does not distinguish between large and small employers". The Court noted that a "simple procedure" involving the preparation of a brief document setting out the nature of discrimination and harassment, the sanctions that attach to it and the course to be followed by an employee who suffers discrimination or harassment should be provided to each employee on recruitment as a matter of routine.</p><p>Such a document "would go some distance towards reducing the chance of sexual harassment [or discrimination] at the employer's workplace and a long way toward enabling the employer (in the absence of knowledge of an actual problem) to make out a defence."</p><p><strong><em>Gilroy v Angelov and Botting and Botting trading as C&amp;T Botting Cleaning, (unreported) No. 465 of 2000, Federal Court, 8 December 2000, per Wilcox J. </em></strong></p></td></tr></table><h4>Principals and their agents</h4><p>The federal Sex Discrimination Act also makes a principal vicariously liable for the unlawful conduct of agents. <a href="#fa1_16">[16]</a> An agent is a person authorised to act on behalf of another (referred to as the principal). If the agent is acting in accordance with the express, implied or ostensible authority conferred on them, the principal is bound by its actions and can be held vicariously liable for its wrongs.

While she was on maternity leave the department in which she had been working was restructured. She was not told of the transfer until the day she returned to work. The complainant alleged that she was arbitrarily returned to a lesser position and that this constituted detriment because the duties did not relate to her area of specialisation, her number of clients dropped drastically and there was not the same scope for interstate travel.</p><p>The Hearing Commissioner decided that the complainant should have been consulted about the changes affecting her role in the department. The fact that the changes did not involve salary or conditions did not prevent a finding of discrimination on the basis that the 'lesser position' was detrimental to the complainant. The Hearing Commissioner found that the complainant's pregnancy must have been a factor leading to the arbitrary change in the complainant's duties. It was her pregnancy that led to her absence on leave. If she had not been on leave, she would have been consulted about the restructure, irrespective of whether or not her transfer to other duties would have taken place.

The Full Bench of the AIRC has held that the nature of the actual employment arrangements under which an employee is employed determines whether they are casual employees. <a href="#fa1_32">[32]</a> More recently, the Full Federal Court decided that the status (or legal character) of employment is determined by the original contract and changes indicating that work has become more regular are irrelevant. <a href="#fa1_33">[33]</a> This means that the Court can look at the terms of the original contract without necessarily considering any other factors of the employment.</p><p>Despite this, all casual and other temporary employees are fully covered by the federal Sex Discrimination Act. <a href="#fa1_34">[34]</a> This means that if a casual employee is dismissed or treated less favourably or suffers other forms of detriment as a result of her pregnancy or potential pregnancy, she is entitled to pursue a claim for unlawful discrimination under the federal Sex Discrimination Act.</p><p>While a casual employee may not have a legislative entitlement to maternity leave, employers should be aware of discrimination issues for casual employees.

It is not uncommon for a person to be employed on a series of short-term contracts, with each term intended to be a new term, independent of the previous term.</p><p>Failing to renew or terminating an employee's fixed-term contract because of her pregnancy or potential pregnancy is unlawful.<a href="#fa1_35">[35] </a>However, a failure to renew may not be discriminatory if the contract is for a set period of time or a one-off specified task with a deadline and the pregnant employee will be absent for a significant part of the time. Employers wishing to avoid discrimination or acts that appear to discriminate should ensure that all other avenues are considered before a contract is terminated, and that written documents supporting the relevant decision are kept.</p><p>A short-term contract worker who has 12 months service with the employer is eligible for maternity leave, although a period of maternity leave will not extend beyond the expiry date of the short-term contract.</p><p>Where an employer is using short-term contracts to avoid the rights of pregnant or potentially pregnant employees, such as reappointment or maternity leave, the employer is likely to be in breach of the federal Sex Discrimination Act.</p><h3><a id="fa1_unpaid" name="fa1_unpaid"></a>2.3 Unpaid workers</h3><p>The federal Sex Discrimination Act does not expressly cover unpaid workers. However, unpaid workers may be covered if they fall within the definition of an 'employee'. Employers and employees should consider the individual circumstances of each case.</p><p>An 'employee' is someone who has an employment contract with an employer. An employment contract need not be in writing. An employment contract consists of a mutual exchange of benefit and an intention to create a legally binding relationship. Although a mutual exchange of benefit generally consists of work in exchange for remuneration, a mutual benefit may also be found when the worker is not being paid. For example, where a person is required to perform a certain amount of work experience to obtain qualifications, the benefit exchanged can be a period of unpaid work in exchange for supervision and experience. <a href="#fa1_36">[36] </a></p><p>It is also possible that if unpaid workers do not fall within the ambit of an employment relationship, they may fall within the provision of the federal Sex Discrimination Act that prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or potential pregnancy in the provision of goods, services or facilities, whether for payment or not. <a href="#fa1_37">[37]</a> Refusing to provide pregnant or potentially pregnant unpaid workers with access to facilities that are accessed by non-pregnant unpaid workers may be unlawful discrimination.</p><p>The provisions of the federal Sex Discrimination Act dealing with Commonwealth laws and programs cover workers participating in unpaid work schemes initiated, funded or administered by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="#fa1_38">[38]</a> This includes the 'Work for the Dole' Scheme and the Community Development Employment Projects Scheme.</p><h3><a id="fa1_commonwealth" name="fa1_commonwealth"></a>2.4 Commonwealth laws and programs</h3><p>The federal Sex Discrimination Act makes it unlawful for an individual or organisation exercising power under a Commonwealth law or program to discriminate on the ground of pregnancy or potential pregnancy. <a href="#39">[39]</a> The federal Sex Discrimination Act would apply to the way in which a Commonwealth Government program is conducted, such as in the allocation of places for a training program and whether a pregnant or potentially pregnant person is offered a place.</p><h3><a id="fa1_2_5" name="fa1_2_5"></a>2.5 Licence agreements and franchise agreements</h3><p>While currently it is unlikely that a licensor or franchisor (the individuals or organisations controlling the whole chain of franchises) could be deemed an employer under the federal Sex Discrimination Act, there may be some circumstances where they may be held vicariously liable.</p><p>Generally, when a franchise is purchased the franchisee not the franchisor is the employer and therefore legally responsible for the employees. The franchisor may however be held responsible when:</p><p> </p><ul><li>the franchisor is seen to be contractually retaining employment rights or responsibilities over employees within the franchise <a href="#fa1_30">[40]</a> (this may be evident from the content of the franchise agreement or the role of the franchisor in establishing employment directions and policies towards franchise employees); or</li><li>the franchisor is seen to cause, instruct, induce, aid or permit the franchise, the franchisee or a franchise employee to do a discriminatory act. <a href="#fa1_41">[41] </a></li></ul><p> </p><p>For example, if a franchisor directs franchise employees to continue to wear a uniform while pregnant, but does not provide uniforms to accommodate the changing shape of a pregnant woman, the franchisor and the franchisee could be held jointly liable for this act, which is likely to be unlawful pregnancy discrimination.</p><h2><a id="fa1_exemptions" name="fa1_exemptions"></a>3.

The effect of an exemption is that the actions or circumstances covered are not unlawful under the federal Sex Discrimination Act while the exemption remains in force. Exemptions are limited in time and scope. For guidance on how to apply for a temporary exemption see the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's <em>Guidelines on Applications for Temporary Exemption under the federal Sex Discrimination Act </em>on the Commission's website at <a href="http://www.humanrights.gov.au">www.humanrights.gov.au</a>.</p><h3><a id="fa1_3_3" name="fa1_3_3"></a>3.3 Special measures</h3><p>The federal Sex Discrimination Act provides that it is not discriminatory to take special measures to achieve substantive equality between women who are pregnant or potentially pregnant, and people who are not pregnant or potentially pregnant. <a href="#fa1_48">[48]</a> One example of a special measure to achieve equality between pregnant women and non-pregnant people would be providing a mentoring program specifically for pregnant women.

It is also about proactive education and putting structures into place that prevent discrimination occurring. In addition, there is a need to establish procedures to follow if there is an issue, or potential issue, of concern.</p><p>In practice, this means developing appropriate pregnancy policies, and establishing procedures to deal with discrimination. While this process is not complex, the following sections have been designed to provide guidance for those developing effective pregnancy policies and procedures.</p><p>In general, policies and procedures covering discrimination benefit both employers and employees. Policies that cover pregnancy specifically will help ensure that treatment of pregnant employees is fair and that managers and employees are made aware of their rights and responsibilities. Having clear policies and procedures in place on issues such as pregnancy may also serve as evidence of an employer seeking to prevent workplace discrimination. However, the existence of a policy is not in itself a sufficient defence to a complaint of discrimination.</p><p>This appendix provides information on developing appropriate pregnancy policies and complaints procedures.</p><hr /><h2><a id="f2_1_pregnancy" name="f2_1_pregnancy"></a>1.

Westpac estimates that the replacement of an employee costs approximately 50% of their annual wage for roles up to and including junior management. Replacement costs for staff in middle and senior management roles were greater and were costed conservatively as being equivalent to one year's salary.

It had not occurred to him that he could have advised her what had happened and allowed her to decide if she should remain at work, seek medical advice or stay at home for a few days.

One further step employers can take to make the workplace free of discrimination and harassment is to provide staff with access to an internal procedure for resolving discrimination and harassment grievances and complaints.</p><p>As an alternative, or at any stage if a complainant is not satisfied with the way a grievance is dealt with internally by her employer, a complaint cn be lodged under the federal Sex Discrimination Act with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</p><p><a href="#contact">Click here to view the Contact</a><a href="/sex_discrimination/pregnancy/guidelines/contact_lists.html"> List. </a></p><p>In some cases, industrial relations legislation may also provide an avenue of redress for concerns relating to discrimination on the ground of pregnancy or potential pregnancy.

This was unlawful discrimination under the NSW <em>Anti-Discrimination Act 1977</em>. In addition, the employer was held liable for the discriminatory actions of the complainant's supervisor, as the employer could not demonstrate that it had taken steps to address the discrimination.</p><p><em><strong>Kolavo v Ainsworth Nominees and Anor (1994) EOC 92-576 </strong></em></p></td></tr></table><p>The federal Sex Discrimination Act does not prescribe any particular type of grievance or complaint procedure so employers have the flexibility to design a system that suits the organisation's size, structure and resources.</p><p>Employers can establish a specific procedure for discrimination complaints or use a procedure that is already in place for other types of work-related grievances. However, discrimination complaints are often complex, sensitive and potentially volatile. It is good practice for anyone dealing with grievances to have some specialist expertise and appropriate training. Access to an external adviser working in the area is also most useful. Failure to handle grievance procedures in an impartial manner is likely to amount to, or exacerbate, a complaint of discrimination against the employer. Employers would be advised to ensure that complaint procedures:</p><ul><li>are clearly documented and accessible to all employees;</li><li>offer both informal and formal options; guarantee timeliness, confidentiality and objectivity;</li><li>are based on the principles of natural justice;</li><li>are administered by trained personnel;</li><li>provide clear guidance on investigation procedures and record keeping;</li><li>give an undertaking that no employee will be victimised or disadvantaged for making a complaint; and</li><li>are regularly reviewed for effectiveness.</li></ul><h3><a id="f_2_3_2_special_needs" name="f_2_3_2_special_needs"></a>3.2 Employees with special needs in accessing grievance procedures</h3><p>One important consideration when establishing policies and grievance procedures is the composition of the workforce.

Employees also need to understand that they have a right to discuss their situation with a union or advocate. It is inappropriate to have a policy that requires internal management of a discrimination issue as mandatory in the first instance.</p><p>Making a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</p><p>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission provides a free complaint handling service. Employees and employers can contact the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for information and assistance with a problem that they feel has been caused by discrimination.</p><p>Employees considering making a complaint should phone the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's Complaints Infoline on 1300 656 419 to discuss their circumstances and obtain information. A complaint must be made in writing, and can be written in any language. If a complainant is unable to formulate a complaint or reduce it to writing, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may provide appropriate assistance. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has a standard form that sets out what information is required as an aid to complainants.</p><p><a href="/complaints_information/index.html">Further information is also available on the Commission's Complaints Information page.</a></p><p><em>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth)</em> requires the President of the Commission to inquire into and attempt, where appropriate, to resolve complaints of unlawful discrimination through a process of conciliation. If a complaint is made, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will generally write to the organisation giving formal advice about the nature of the complaint. A respondent does not require legal advice to respond to a complaint but legal advice may be obtained if desired.</p><p>If the complaint proceeds to conciliation, the role of the conciliator is to conduct the conciliation conference in a fair and impartial manner, giving each party an opportunity to present their point of view and assist them in resolving the complaint. The conciliator may make suggestions for terms of settlement, give expert advice on settlement terms and actively encourage the parties to reach an agreement. The conciliator is not an advocate for either party and will help both parties understand the complaint and explain the areas where conciliated results work most effectively. The conciliator also has a role to ensure that settlement terms are in accordance with the principles of the legislation.</p><p>If a complaint cannot be conciliated or is terminated for any other reason by the President, the complainant can apply to the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Magistrate's Service to have the case heard.</p><p>Further information on complaints is available from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the free publication entitled <em>The Complaint Guide: An introduction for people considering making a complaint, or responding to a complaint, before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </em></p><p><a href="#append_c">See Appendix C for a discussion of alternative complaints forums. </a></p><h2><a id="fa2_4_special_needs" name="fa2_4_special_needs"></a>4.

Sound management practices would allow employees access to adequate leave to meet these needs and regular consultation between employers and employees allows employees to schedule leave at mutually convenient times. Travelling long distances to antenatal services can be particularly difficult in the later stages of pregnancy and in some cases, employees may wish to commence maternity leave early.</p><p>In order to avoid discrimination, or acts that appear discriminatory, consideration should be given to how a variety of leave options may best be used to accommodate such circumstances including annual leave, sick leave, leave without pay or maternity leave.</p><h3><a id="f2_4_2" name="f2_4_2"></a>4.2 Apprentices and trainees <a href="#fa2_7">[7] </a></h3><p>Lack of workplace experience sometimes results in limited understanding of anti-discrimination laws. For adolescent and school aged women who are pregnant, this can be exacerbated by the difficulties associated with completing school or training, obtaining employment, working part-time or casually and combating community prejudices.</p><p>Generally, apprentices will need to suspend their indentures during maternity leave and should discuss this with the authority regulating apprenticeships in the relevant State or Territory.</p><p>Female apprentices and trainees sometimes find themselves in competitive male dominated industries where management is unfamiliar with the practical management of pregnancy and potential pregnancy issues and anti-discrimination law.</p><p>Employers of young women should ensure that they are well informed about their rights and responsibilities and provide pregnant employees with specific information.</p><p>Employers should also:</p><ul><li>take steps to ensure that co-workers are aware that discrimination and harassment of pregnant employees is unlawful;</li><li>ensure that recruitment processes for apprentices, trainees or junior employees are in compliance with the federal Sex Discrimination Act; and</li><li>ensure that discrimination policies and training clearly cover the issues that pregnant apprentices and trainees face.</li></ul><p>Failing to take on a female apprentice because she may become pregnant, encouraging a pregnant apprentice to discontinue her apprenticeship or dismissing an apprentice because she is pregnant, or has indicated an intention to become pregnant, is unlawful.</p><h3><a id="f2_4_3" name="f2_4_3"></a>4.3 Family diversity</h3><p>Employees come from, and make up, a diverse range of family types, both with and without children, including married couples, single parent families, extended families, and heterosexual, gay and lesbian defacto couples.</p><p>Single parents and unmarried or lesbian women who are pregnant are at times subjected to discriminatory attitudes and behaviours. The federal Sex Discrimination Act protects pregnant and potentially pregnant employees irrespective of their marital status. Protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual preference is available under the <em>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986</em> (Cth) and most State and Territory anti-discrimination laws.</p><p>Employers should be aware that the support person for a pregnant woman will not always be a husband. But like a husband, support people may be required to attend medical appointments with a pregnant family member.</p><h3><a id="f2_4_4" name="f2_4_4"></a>4.4 Culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds</h3><p>Pregnant or potentially pregnant employees from diverse cultural or linguistic backgrounds may have particular needs that raise management issues for employers.</p><p>The term "culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds" refers to a wide range of people from different backgrounds, including immigrants from non-English speaking countries, people born in Australia who have a minority ethnic background and Indigenous people. Employers should be aware that the following issues might require special attention in managing pregnancy in the workplace:</p><p> </p><ul><li>employees may have difficulties with English and may not understand company policies, their rights and responsibilities or have difficulty communicating their own needs;</li><li>cultural differences may mean that an employee has special requests relating to her own customary practices and traditions around pregnancy; and</li><li>employees may have a lack of awareness of procedures and services in Australia, sometimes even a fear or distrust of government bodies that provide information.</li></ul><p>Consultation with the individual employee is the most effective way to manage these issues. However, managers should be aware that some female employees may not feel comfortable discussing pregnancy related issues with a male manager. Sensitivity and common sense should be used in such circumstances.</p><p>It is important that employers of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds ensure that all employees are aware of their rights and responsibilities in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy at work. Information and training should be provided in a manner that is culturally appropriate and acknowledges English as a second language. Company policy information may need to be translated into different languages. <a href="#fa2_8">[8]</a></p><h3><a id="f2_4_5" name="f2_4_5"></a>4.5 Indigenous employees</h3><p>Indigenous communities are diverse and cultural practices vary from community to community. Particular traditions may give rise to unique needs in relation to pregnancy and maternity leave, while others may not. Issues also vary according to the geographical location of the employee and that of their community. Managers should be aware of the following factors and raise them for discussion with a pregnant employee in order to develop sound management strategies:</p><p> </p><ul><li>some Indigenous women may wish to return home for the birth of their child and this may require extensive travel to remote areas, hence early commencement of maternity leave;</li><li>the high incidence of diabetes and other health concerns amongst Indigenous women means that some Indigenous employees require additional sick leave during their pregnancy;</li><li>Indigenous women in remote or isolated locations may suffer serious illness that requires both time and travel, which again may require additional sick leave; and</li><li>Indigenous women may be reticent to assert their legal rights or to approach management to discuss matters of concern.</li></ul><p>Employers should note that when managing the employment relationship with a pregnant Indigenous woman, they must comply with both the federal Sex Discrimination Act and the federal <em>Racial Discrimination Act 1975</em> (Cth).</p><p> </p><h3><a id="f2_4_6" name="f2_4_6"></a>4.6 Women with disabilities</h3><p>Some women with disabilities will have particular needs when managing their pregnancy at work. These needs should be determined on a case by case basis and will depend upon the nature and extent of the disability. Employers may wish to seek external advice on appropriate modifications to accommodate particular situations. The following points should be noted:</p><ul><li>employers should not assume that a pregnant employee does not have a disability just because it is not visibly evident, for example, pre-existing back injuries may be exacerbated by pregnancy and in need of accommodation;</li><li>some women with disabilities may require information on their rights and responsibilities to be provided in suitable formats, for example, on an audio cassette for employees who are vision impaired;</li><li>some physical disabilities may require additional modification of work duties during pregnancy;</li><li>women with intellectual disabilities who are pregnant may need additional leave from work; and</li><li>employers have a responsibility to provide a safe and harassment-free environment for women with disabilities who, due to the personal attitudes of some co-workers and supervisors, may be subjected to harassment during their pregnancy.</li></ul><p>Employers should note that when managing the employment relationship with a pregnant employee with a disability, they must comply with both the federal Sex Discrimination Act and the federal <em>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</em> (Cth).</p><h2><a id="f2_5_checklist" name="f2_5_checklist"></a>5.

Legally, this obligation arises from OH&amp;S laws that apply throughout Australia. OH&amp;S laws have been enacted in each State and Territory. <a href="#fa3_1">[1]</a></p><p>In managing pregnancy and potential pregnancy in the workplace, OH&amp;S and anti-discrimination law must be dealt with simultaneously. The challenge for employers is to balance the requirements of each. The obligation under OH&amp;S law is to ensure a safe place of work for all employees. This requirement must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. At workplaces where both the federal Sex Discrimination Act and State or Territory OH&amp;S laws apply, the federal Sex Discrimination Act should be followed to the extent of any inconsistency. <a href="#fa3_2">[2]</a></p><p>Risks to pregnant and potentially pregnant employees should be assessed objectively, free from discriminatory assumptions and stereotypes. While each situation must be individually considered, the following guidelines provide general assistance for the evaluation of workplace risks.</p><h3><a id="fa3_1_1" name="fa3_1_1"></a>1.1 Duty of care in OH&amp;S law</h3><p>Both federal and State or Territory OH&amp;S laws require employers to ensure the health, safety and welfare of their employees at work. <a href="#fa3_3">[3]</a> While in some cases, this is expressed as a general duty of care, most laws provide a list of specific duties. Failure to discharge any of these duties is a breach of the employer's overall duty of care. These duties of care include:</p><ul><li>the duty to ensure safe systems of work;</li><li>the duty to ensure safety and absence of risks in use, handling, storage or transport of plant and substances;</li><li>the duty to provide training and supervision to ensure employees are safe from injuries and risks to health;</li><li>the duty to provide adequate facilities; and</li><li>the duty to ensure that visitors to the workplace are aware of safety requirements and abide by them.</li></ul><p>Employers' duty of care obligation, common to all jurisdictions, requires providing a safe work environment for all employees. Establishing a safe work environment will generally ensure a safe work environment for pregnant and potentially pregnant employees.</p><p> </p><table name="Case Example"><tr><td><h4>Case example: Duty of care in OH&amp;S law</h4><p>The complainant, a pregnant woman, was dismissed from her position as a bar attendant because the employer thought that there was a danger she might fall on the slippery floors behind the bar. The employer said there was concern for the complainant's safety and welfare due to her pregnancy. The employer also claimed to be concerned about possible exposure to common law liability for other possible injuries suffered by the complainant.</p><p>The Tribunal said that the employer had not acted reasonably and was not justified in dismissing a pregnant employee for whom the workplace was unsafe. Instead the workplace needed to be made safe for all employees. It was not reasonable to dismiss the complainant because it was convenient to do so. Damages were awarded in favour of the complainant.</p><p><strong><em>Allegretta v Prime Holdings (1991) EOC 92-364 </em></strong></p></td></tr></table><h3><a id="fa3_1_2" name="fa3_1_2"></a>1.2 OH&amp;S and pregnancy</h3><p>The general rule for satisfying OH&amp;S issues for pregnant employees is to <em><strong>provide a safe workplace for all workers</strong></em>. In some work environments, however, pregnant and potentially pregnant employees are exposed to particular risks not faced by other workers. While OH&amp;S laws rarely deal with specific conditions such as pregnancy, the general 'duty of care' obligations automatically extend to cover the management of pregnant and potentially pregnant employees. Relevant issues may include:</p><ul><li>containment or removal of hazardous substances, such as chemicals, metals, gases or biological hazards to which a pregnant or breastfeeding woman, or her child, are particularly susceptible;</li><li>identification and management of high risk physical tasks, such as heavy lifting, tasks requiring constant use of stairs or long periods of work on ladders;</li><li>making provision for pregnant employees to work seated rather than standing;</li><li>providing regular access to toilet breaks;</li><li>avoiding the allocation of duties to pregnant employees that require long periods of working outside on hot days;</li><li>avoiding exposure to infectious diseases; and</li><li>providing alternative duties where tasks involve high lead exposure.</li></ul><p>It is important for employers to be aware of any potential risks and actively address any OH&amp;S issues raised. Workplaces with obvious risks or frequent issues should develop specific policies that provide guidelines for staff and managers.</p><p>External medical advice may be of assistance. Employers can request that a pregnant employee provide a medical certificate, having previously discussed with the employee what information the certificate should include. However, employers should note that requesting medical certificates too frequently or repeatedly for the same purpose may constitute pregnancy discrimination.<a href="#fa3_3">[4]</a></p><p>Where medical advice is available and the employer is made aware of it, but does not follow it, the employer may be liable for any injury or harm that occurs as a result of failing to follow the advice.</p><p>Specific advice on individual workplaces may be obtained by contacting federal and State or Territory OH&amp;S bodies. These bodies work together to establish standards and codes of practice.<a href="#fa3_5">[5]</a> A standard sets the required level of preventative action, and usually relates to a specific workplace hazard. A code of practice generally sets out the best way to achieve the standard. <a href="#fa3_6">[6]</a> For example, the <em>National Code of Practice for Manual Handling</em> requires employers to take account of special needs such as pregnancy in the risk assessment process. <a href="#fa3_7">[7]</a> The <em>National Standard for the Control of Inorganic Lead</em> at Work lists the circumstances in which pregnancy is a criterion for exclusion from a lead-risk job. <a href="#fa3_8">[8] </a></p><p>Employers should be aware that in some cases codes may contravene the federal Sex Discrimination Act. Sometimes the code will identify this and indicate that employers should seek an exemption under the federal Sex Discrimination Act. This is most important if employers are unable to resolve the differences between their OH&amp;S obligations, the relevant code and anti-discrimination law requirements. <a href="#fa3_9">[9] </a></p><p><a href="#append_a">Visit Appendix A for further information. </a></p><p>Further information on managing OH&amp;S and anti-discrimination obligations, particularly in relation to the lead industry, is contained in Chapter 9 of the <a href="/sex_discrimination/publication/pregnancy/report.html">Pregnancy Report. </a></p><h2><a id="fa3_2_industrial_relations" name="fa3_2_industrial_relations"></a>2. The relationship between anti-discrimination and industrial relations laws Industrial relations and anti-discrimination laws both impact upon the employment relationship.</h2><p>Industrial relations laws at the federal and State or Territory level regulates the workplace and the employment relationship. Anti-discrimination laws at the federal and State or Territory level prohibits discriminatory conduct, particularly in the workplace.</p><p>A number of provisions in the federal <em>Workplace Relations Act 1996</em> are concerned with discrimination against pregnant and potentially pregnant employees. <a href="#fa3_10">[10]</a></p><p>The AIRC must take into account anti-discrimination principles when undertaking several of its functions, including:</p><ul><li>dispute handling and settlement, in particular by the making of new awards; <a href="#fa3_11">[11]</a></li><li>certification of agreements; <a href="#fa3_12">[12]</a> and</li><li>the handling of discrimination complaints arising because of the discriminatory nature of awards or agreements. <a href="#fa3_13">[13]</a></li></ul><p>Some discriminatory acts by an employer may contravene both industrial relations and anti-discrimination laws. Awards and agreements should not be discriminatory in their operation. In addition, awards and agreements can supplement laws by providing entitlements to non-discriminatory treatment or particular benefits in connection with pregnancy.</p><p>An employee, whose employment has been terminated due to sex, pregnancy or absence from work during maternity leave, may apply to the AIRC for relief. <a href="#fa_3_14">[14] </a></p><p>A complaint of pregnancy or potential pregnancy discrimination in employment may also be made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</p><p><a href="#append_b">Visit Appendix B</a> for more information or <a href="#contact">Click here to view the Contact List.</a></p><h2><a id="fa3_3_alternative" name="fa3_3_alternative"></a>3. Alternative complaint forums</h2><h3><a id="fa3_3_1" name="fa3_3_1"></a>3.1 The Australian Industrial Relations Commission or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission?</h3><h4>Discrimination resulting from a federal award or agreement</h4><p>Discriminatory actions arising from direct compliance with an award or agreement are exempted from a finding of unlawful discrimination under the federal Sex Discrimination Act. <a href="#fa_3_15">[15]</a> However, a formal complaint may still be made. <a href="#fa3_16">[16]</a> If the complaint appears substantiated (but for the exemption for awards and agreements), the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will refer the matter to the AIRC for examination. If the AIRC finds that the award or agreement is discriminatory it must remove the discrimination. <a href="#fa3_17">[17]</a></p><p>This referral power does not apply to federal Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs). Allegations of discrimination arising from compliance with AWAs may be dealt with directly by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</p><p>Employers should note that under some State anti-discrimination laws, compliance with an award or agreement provides no defence for discriminatory conduct. Employers covered by State awards and agreements should therefore consider whether the provisions in their awards and agreements unlawfully discriminate on the ground of pregnancy or potential pregnancy. If there is the possibility of unlawful discrimination, employers should take steps to remove the discriminatory provision or ensure that they provide terms and conditions that do not unlawfully discriminate.</p><h4>Discrimination resulting from termination of employment</h4><p>An employee who is dismissed because of her pregnancy can make a complaint under the federal Sex Discrimination Act or to the AIRC under the federal <em>Workplace Relations Act 1996. </em></p><p>The federal Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides that termination of employment on the ground of sex, pregnancy <a href="#fa3_18">[18]</a> or absence due to maternity leave <a href="#fa3_19">[19]</a> is prohibited and relief may be sought from the AIRC. <a href="#fa3_20">[20]</a> It should be noted, however, that a number of categories of employment are excluded from the termination of employment provisions of the federal Workplace Relations Act 1996. These include trainees where the traineeship is for a specified period, and casual employees engaged for less than 12 months. <a href="#fa3_21">[21]</a> The exclusions do not apply under the federal Sex Discrimination Act and all trainees, casuals and other short term employees are covered.</p><h3><a id="fa3_3_2" name="fa3_3_2"></a>3.2 State and Territory anti-discrimination bodies or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission?</h3><p>In addition to the federal Sex Discrimination Act, anti-discrimination laws in all States and Territories prohibit discrimination on the ground of pregnancy. <a href="#fa3_22">[22]</a> The federal Sex Discrimination Act is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of a State or Territory anti-discrimination law <a href="#fa3_23">[23]</a> that is capable of operating concurrently with the federal Sex Discrimination Act. This means that where provisions of the federal Sex Discrimination Act and State and Territory anti-discrimination Acts are similar, and can operate together, both will apply. In the event of inconsistency, the federal Sex Discrimination Act should be followed.</p><p>The majority of employers are required to comply with both the federal and the relevant State or Territory anti-discrimination Act. While generally there is consistency between these laws, sound employment practices and compliance with the higher standard will ensure employers avoid potential legislative breaches.</p><h3><a id="fa3_3" name="fa3_3"></a>3.3 Making complaints in alternative forums</h3><p>If an employee believes that they have been treated less favourably or dismissed because of their pregnancy or potential pregnancy they may have a choice about which forum to make a complaint.</p><p>Federal and State or Territory anti-discrimination laws generally cover the same grounds and areas of discrimination. There are, however, some circumstances where only the federal law applies or only the State or Territory law applies. For example, if an employee is employed by a federal Government department she can only make a complaint about pregnancy discrimination in employment under federal law. State Government employees are only entitled to lodge complaints under State or Territory law. If both federal and State laws seem to apply, the employee needs to choose the forum in which she will make a complaint.</p><p>However, there is a general principle that a person cannot make a complaint to two different forums about the same subject matter. This principle is in place to avoid "double dipping". The federal Sex Discrimination Act specifically provides that a person cannot lodge a complaint under both federal and State or Territory law. If a person starts a complaint under State or Territory law, they cannot later decide to make the complaint under a federal law. <a href="#fa3_24">[24]</a> However, a person can start under the federal law and decide to move the complaint to State or Territory law.</p><p>When choosing between anti-discrimination and industrial relations laws the general principle against "double dipping" also applies. A person cannot make a complaint about the same subject matter with a view to obtaining exactly the same remedy in two jurisdictions. Some industrial relations laws specifically prevent people making multiple complaints at the same time. For example, the federal Workplace Relations Act 1996 prevents a person from bringing proceedings under more than one Act in relation to the same subject matter.<a href="#fa3_25">[25]</a> Therefore, proceedings relating to allegations concerning a woman being unfairly dismissed because of her pregnancy cannot be brought under the federal Workplace Relations Act 1996 if a complaint has already been made under the federal Sex Discrimination Act or a State or Territory anti-discrimination Act.</p><p>Often complaints about alleged discrimination in the workplace are quite complex and do not fit easily under one law. In these circumstances an employee could pursue certain parts of their complaint under industrial relations law and other parts under anti-discrimination law. However, one jurisdiction may have broader coverage and an employee may prefer to make a complaint to the body that can deal with the entire subject matter, rather than obtain partial remedies in separate jurisdictions.</p><p>Where the law allows it, it is up to an employee to elect under which law they want to lodge a complaint. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, State and Territory anti-discrimination bodies and industrial relations bodies can provide information about what their law covers and how complaints will be handled.</p><p><a href="#contact">Click here to view the Contact List</a></p><p>Employees may seek advice from trade unions or legal advisers when making this decision. Issues that an employee may consider when choosing a forum to make a complaint are:</p><p> </p><ul><li>the process for handling the complaint;</li><li>the timeframe for making the complaint;</li><li>the remedies available;</li><li>the costs associated with making the complaint;</li><li>the necessity for legal representation;</li><li>the waiting times for taking action on the complaint;</li><li>the accessibility of the service; and</li><li>whether the forum can deal with the entire complaint.</li></ul><p> </p><hr /><p><a id="fa3_1" name="fa3_1"></a>1.
