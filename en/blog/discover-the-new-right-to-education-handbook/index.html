However, millions are still deprived of educational opportunities every day, many as a result of social, cultural and economic factors.</p><p>UNESCO and the <a href="https://www.right-to-education.org/">Right to Education Initiative</a> (RTE) recently released the <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000366556/PDF/366556eng.pdf.multi">Right to Education Handbook</a>, a key tool for those seeking to understand and advance that right. It is also an important reference for people working towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4 by offering guidance on how to leverage legal commitment to the right to education.</p><h4><b>Why is this handbook important?</b></h4><p>The aim of this handbook is to make sure that everyone enjoys their right to education. Its objective is not to present the right to education as an abstract, conceptual, or purely legal concept, but rather to be action-oriented. It provides practical guidance on how to implement and monitor the right to education along with recommendations to overcome persistent barriers. It seeks to do this by:</p><ul><li>Increasing awareness and knowledge of the right to education. This includes the normative angle of the right to education, states’ legal obligations, the various sources of law, what states must do to implement it, how to monitor it, and how to increase accountability.</li><li>Providing a summary of current debates and issues regarding education and what human rights law says about them, including on forced migration, education in emergencies, the privatization of education, and the challenge of reaching the most marginalized.</li><li>Providing an overview of the UN landscape and its mechanisms, including a clear understanding of <a href="https://en.unesco.org/themes/right-to-education/action">the role of UNESCO</a> and more generally the United Nations, as well as all relevant actors in education, particularly civil society.</li></ul><h4><b>Who should use this handbook?</b></h4><p>The <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000366556">handbook</a> was developed to assist all stakeholders who have a crucial role to play in the promotion and implementation of the right to education. This includes:</p><ul><li>State officials, to ensure that education policies and practices are better aligned with human rights.</li><li>Civil servants, policy-makers, ministers, and the ministry of education staff, officials working in ministries and departments of justice, development, finance, and statistics, as well as National Human Rights Institutions.</li><li>Parliamentarians, their researchers and members of staff will find this handbook useful in evaluating and formulating education, human rights, and development legislation, and in implementing international human rights commitments to national law.</li><li>Judges, magistrates, clerks, and lawyers and other judicial officials can use the material to explain the legal obligations of the state and how to apply them.</li><li>Civil society including NGOs, development organizations, academics, researchers, teachers and journalists will benefit from this handbook as it includes guidance on how to incorporate the right to education in programmatic, research, and advocacy work.</li></ul><p>Those who work for inter-governmental organizations, including at key UN agencies, will find this handbook useful in carrying out the mandate of their organizations. Private actors, multilateral and bilateral donors, and investors can use this handbook to ensure their involvement complies with human rights and that they understand and can apply their specific responsibilities.</p><h4><b>How to use this handbook?</b></h4><p>The <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000366556">handbook</a> was designed to be accessible. Each chapter starts with the key questions addressed in the chapter and ends with a short summary consisting of key points and ‘ask yourself’ questions, designed to make the reader think deeper about issues raised in the chapter or to encourage people find out more about the situation in their own country.</p><p>For more than 70 years, UNESCO has been defending and advancing the right to education, which lies at the heart of its mandate. It recently ran a digital campaign on the <a href="https://en.unesco.org/themes/right-to-%C3%A9ducation/campaign">#RightToEducation</a> to mark the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.unesco.org/themes/right-to-education/action">What UNESCO does for the right to education</a></li><li><a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/what-you-need-know-about-right-education">What you need to know about the right to education</a></li><li><a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/what-can-i-do-help-advance-right-education">What can I do to help advance the right to education?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2izn9XSNzww&amp;feature=youtu.be">WATCH: What UNESCO does to uphold the right to education</a></li></ul></div>
